# pf1e-content

Converted/imported content for Foundry VTT PF1e

This module comprises a host of content for Pathfinder 1st ed. for Foundry.

## Included Content:

- 4,200 magic items (including ammo, rods, weapons, armor, artifacts, cursed items, staffs, and wondrous items)

- 3,501 feats sourced directly from Archives of Nethys

- 2,034 traits sourced directly from Archives of Nethys

- 146 buffs and variants

While the feats and traits should contain nearly all entries, there might be a few missing. If you notice one missing, please open an issue or pm one of us on Discord (fadedshadow589#8270 or Kronos#5516). These remaining compendiums are not perfect. Except for buffs, none of them contain the appropriate changes to attacks, armor bonuses, etc. However, the item description and most of the relevant info needed to make them are typically included. Several magic items have default art pointing towards the pf1 system, but most are missing art. 

Before altering any of the compendium databases, it is strongly recommended you create a personal copy of each to prevent the originals from being overwritten.

3.5 feats and traits are in a separate compendium. They are enabled by default and can be manually disabled.

## Installation

If you want to install this module manually, use the main release download .zip.
Unzip the file and transfer the pf-content folder to FoundryVTT\Data\modules.

To install through Foundry, click on the Add-on Modules tab, then the Install Module button, and search for Pathfinder 1e Content.

## Templates for Data Toolbox for Foundry VTT:
Within the templates folder is the .json files I used, however they required a significant amount of cleaning of the excel files to work without issue. You can contact me if you would like access to the cleaned file.

Not all the information is present in the items, however, all the important bits are included in the description of each, so making the appropriate bonuses/attack, etc. shouldn't be too diffiult.
