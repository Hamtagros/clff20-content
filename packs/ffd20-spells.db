At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the carriage, horses, and coachman disappear into nothingness, depositing everything on or in it on the ground in its space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/s/summon-carriage/\">Summon Carriage</a></p>","spellDuration":"1 hour/level (D)","spellEffect":"one quasi-real carriage, horses, and driver","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1},"flags":{"importid":"2RHb26iGObhgAZIK"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

This illumination increases the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 20-foot radius of this magical light.

When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points&rsquo; worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.</p>\n<p>Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.</p>\n<p>As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can&rsquo;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death&rsquo;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>In this case, &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can&rsquo;t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p>\n<p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&rsquo;t qualify.</p>\n<p>When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol&rsquo;s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&rsquo;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p>\n<p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p>\n<p>Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol&rsquo;s spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p>\n<p>A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel targeted solely on the rune.

At the end of a creature&rsquo;s turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed.

If a character is warded by protection from elements and elemental resistance, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/e/elemental-resistance/\">Elemental Resistance</a></p>","spellDuration":"10 minute/level","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1},"flags":{"importid":"Ul4t8P0UVLXfBg79"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

This movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without affecting them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that blocks its movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/c/cloak-of-winds/\">Cloak of Winds</a></p>","spellDuration":"1 minute/level","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1},"flags":{"importid":"NU4wT9zWnd8hwFVI"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 round per caster level. In addition, the subject&rsquo;s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p>\n<p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be raised). A spellcasting creature that has a MP pool loses 50% of its magic points upon being raised.</p>\n<p>A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.</p>\n<p>You can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created can be horizontal or vertical, though if it is created horizontally the foundations must be strong enough to hold it, both horizontal and vertical creations must merge with existing stone. The size of the wall cannot exceed 1.5x the stone it originates from (a hand-sized rock cannot create a wall). This wall can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell&rsquo;s area by half.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.</p>\n<p>You can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created can be horizontal or vertical, though if it is created horizontally the foundations must be strong enough to hold it, both horizontal and vertical creations must merge with existing stone. The size of the wall cannot exceed 1.5x the stone it originates from (a hand-sized rock cannot create a wall). This wall can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell&rsquo;s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.</p>\n<p>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
