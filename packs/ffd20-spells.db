If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p>\n<p>Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&rsquo;s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&rsquo;s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</p>\n<p>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject&rsquo;s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be reincarnated).

this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject&rsquo;s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p>\n<p>Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&rsquo;s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&rsquo;s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</p>\n<p>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject&rsquo;s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be reincarnated). A character who died with&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">a MP Pool</span>&nbsp;has a 25% chance of losing&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">all MP.</span></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible for the change in the subject&rsquo;s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.</p>\n<p>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.</p>\n<p>A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can&rsquo;t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can&rsquo;t be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p>\n<p>The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn&rsquo;t automatically speak the language of the new form.</p>\n<table width=\"330\" cellspacing=\"0\"

If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be raised). A spellcasting creature that has a MP pool loses 50% of its magic points upon being raised.</p>\n<p>A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature&rsquo;s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.</p>\n<p>A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can&rsquo;t be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can&rsquo;t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/a/arise/\">Arise</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/raise/\">Raise</a></p>\n</nav><nav></nav></div>\n</div>\n</footer>","spellDuration":"instantaneous","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{"importid":"2mIoDAduzddbayDA"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"5suQGnGmpWMMTKER"}

When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points&rsquo; worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.</p>\n<p>Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.</p>\n<p>As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can&rsquo;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death&rsquo;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>In this case, &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can&rsquo;t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p>\n<p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&rsquo;t qualify.</p>\n<p>When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol&rsquo;s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&rsquo;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p>\n<p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p>\n<p>Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol&rsquo;s spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p>\n<p>A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel targeted solely on the rune.

Interplanar travel is not possible, and the spell fails on any plane where time is meaningless. The character can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per caster level. Unwilling creatures cannot be affected by this spell. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</p>\n<p>To cast this spell, the character must be able to state the arrival time accurately, down to the minute. The spell never transports the caster and companions to the precise minute desired, but it cannot function at all without a specific minute in time to target. This &ldquo;drift&rdquo; effect of not arriving at the precise time desired grows with the &ldquo;distance&rdquo; through time (measured in years, months, and weeks) traveled. Thus, a caster teleporting to last month arrives closer to her goal than one traveling 250 years. The minimum temporal distance traveled is 1 day, so this spell is not useful for going back to the beginning of a melee that is still progressing.</p>\n<p>This spell requires some knowledge of the destination time, so it cannot transport anyone into the future since the future is entirely unknown to the caster. Even spells that give knowledge of the future cannot give definite enough knowledge to allow this spell to work. It is possible to use this spell to travel forward in time, but only to the point in the caster&rsquo;s life when the caster first went back in time. Since the caster may not know exactly what is transpiring at the destination time, prudent time-travelers prepare for the worst. The errors in arrival for this spell occur in time rather than in location, since the character does not change locations at all. To see how closely the character arrives to the planned arrival time, consult this table:</p>\n<p>Table: Time Walk</p>\n<table border=\"solid\" cellpadding=\"2px\" data-darkreader-inline-border-top=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-right=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-left=\"\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">Distance Traveled (Temporal)</td>\n<td data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">Drift* Chance</td>\n<td data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">Mishap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 day to 1 month</td>\n<td>+/- d8 minutes</td>\n<td>5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 month to 1 year</td>\n<td>+/- d8 hours</td>\n<td>7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 year to 10 years</td>\n<td>+/- d20 hours</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 years to 100 years</td>\n<td>+/- d8 days</td>\n<td>15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 years to 1,000 years</td>\n<td>+/- d20 days</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,000 years +</td>\n<td>+/- d20 months</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Add or subtract the temporal drift to the destination time to determine the exact time of arrival. Mishaps result in the spell failing and the character taking 1 point of Intelligence damage for every 10 years of expected time travel due to the mental bombardment that time travel brings with it. Thus, a character trying to transport through 100 years would take 10 points of Intelligence damage.

Interplanar travel is not possible, and the spell fails on any plane where time is meaningless. The character can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per caster level. Unwilling creatures cannot be affected by this spell. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</p>\n<p>To cast this spell, the character must be able to state the arrival time accurately, down to the minute. The spell never transports the caster and companions to the precise minute desired, but it cannot function at all without a specific minute in time to target. This &ldquo;drift&rdquo; effect of not arriving at the precise time desired grows with the &ldquo;distance&rdquo; through time (measured in years, months, and weeks) traveled. Thus, a caster teleporting to last month arrives closer to her goal than one traveling 250 years. The minimum temporal distance traveled is 1 day, so this spell is not useful for going back to the beginning of a melee that is still progressing.</p>\n<p>This spell requires some knowledge of the destination time, so it cannot transport anyone into the future since the future is entirely unknown to the caster. Even spells that give knowledge of the future cannot give definite enough knowledge to allow this spell to work. It is possible to use this spell to travel forward in time, but only to the point in the caster&rsquo;s life when the caster first went back in time. Since the caster may not know exactly what is transpiring at the destination time, prudent time-travelers prepare for the worst. The errors in arrival for this spell occur in time rather than in location, since the character does not change locations at all. To see how closely the character arrives to the planned arrival time, consult this table:</p>\n<p>Table: Time Walk</p>\n<table border=\"solid\" cellpadding=\"2px\" data-darkreader-inline-border-top=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-right=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-left=\"\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">Distance Traveled (Temporal)</td>\n<td data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">Drift* Chance</td>\n<td data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">Mishap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 day to 1 month</td>\n<td>+/- d8 minutes</td>\n<td>5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 month to 1 year</td>\n<td>+/- d8 hours</td>\n<td>7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 year to 10 years</td>\n<td>+/- d20 hours</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 years to 100 years</td>\n<td>+/- d8 days</td>\n<td>15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 years to 1,000 years</td>\n<td>+/- d20 days</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,000 years +</td>\n<td>+/- d20 months</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Add or subtract the temporal drift to the destination time to determine the exact time of arrival. Mishaps result in the spell failing and the character taking 1 point of Intelligence damage for every 10 years of expected time travel due to the mental bombardment that time travel brings with it. Thus, a character trying to transport through 100 years would take 10 points of Intelligence damage. Intelligence can be reduced to 0 through this damage (but not lower).</p>\n<p>In the case that a traveler meets himself, the two travelers instantly lose control and attack each other with every ability and item at their disposal. However, should a traveler die while traveling in the past, the traveler&rsquo;s body immediately vanishes from the point of time it traveled to and returns to the point where the spell was cast at the time that the spell was cast. In other words, if a traveler perishes in a fire, the instant that the traveler died in that fire is the instant in which the traveler is no longer in that time period, and the body is never found within that location since it returns to the moment of time in which the traveler finished the spell and began time traveling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/t/time-walk/\">Time Walk</a></p>","spellDuration":"instantaneous","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{"importid":"q9MlgDbbWtaRHLjP"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"J225Azrb5HyR1ddl"}

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by dispel. Dispel can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel can take effect.</p>\n<p>You choose to use dispel in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p>\n<p>Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p>\n<p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17).

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by dispel. Dispel can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel can take effect.</p>\n<p>You choose to use dispel in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p>\n<p>Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p>\n<p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p>\n<p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p>\n<p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p>\n<p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item&rsquo;s caster level (DC = 11 + the item&rsquo;s caster level).

Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p>\n<h2>Table: Bend Space and Time</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Familiarity</th>\n<th>On Target</th>\n<th>&nbsp;Off Target</th>\n<th>Similar</th>\n<th>Mishap</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Very familiar</td>\n<td>01&ndash;97</td>\n<td>98&ndash;99</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Studied carefully</td>\n<td>01&ndash;94</td>\n<td>95&ndash;97</td>\n<td>98&ndash;99</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seen casually</td>\n<td>01&ndash;88</td>\n<td>89&ndash;94</td>\n<td>95&ndash;98</td>\n<td>99&ndash;100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viewed Once</td>\n<td>01&ndash;76</td>\n<td>77&ndash;88</td>\n<td>89&ndash;96</td>\n<td>97&ndash;100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>False destination</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&mdash;</td>\n<td>81&ndash;92</td>\n<td>93&ndash;100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Familiarity&nbsp;&ldquo;Very familiar&rdquo; is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. &ldquo;Studied carefully&rdquo; is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you&rsquo;ve been there often. &ldquo;Seen casually&rdquo; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. &ldquo;Viewed once&rdquo; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;False destination&rdquo;&nbsp;is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p>\n<p>On Target&nbsp;you appear where you want to be.</p>\n<p>Off Target&nbsp;you appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. the direction off target is determined randomly.</p>\n<p>Similar Area&nbsp;you wind up in an area that&rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. if no such area exists within the spell&rsquo;s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>\n<p>Mishap&nbsp;You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &ldquo;scrambled.&rdquo; You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time &ldquo;Mishap&rdquo; comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/t/teleport-object/\">Teleport Object</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/b/bend-space-and-time/\">Bend Space and Time</a></p>","spellDuration":"instantaneous","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{"importid":"FdWH0FILcIyeJ1h2"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"MhC4xxpDl5PhabR5"}

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave&rsquo;s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.</p>\n<p>When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of water damage (if the tsunami) or 6d6 points of earth damage (if the swell).</p>\n<p>The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one geomancer class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p>The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave&rsquo;s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.</p>\n<p>The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).</p>\n<p>You can only create the wave if standing on the ground.

In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is Spell Resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and Spell Resistance.</p>\n<p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>\n<p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the following table.

In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is Spell Resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and Spell Resistance.</p>\n<p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>\n<p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the following table.
