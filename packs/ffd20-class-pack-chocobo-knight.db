class features of the chocobo knight.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Chocobo knights are proficient with all simple, martial weapons, and knight swords and with all armor (light, medium, and heavy) and shields (including tower shields).</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the chocobo knight receives the Limit Breaks (Fight as One and Supreme Overrun).</p>\n<p><em>Fight as One (Su):&nbsp;</em>This Limit Break allows the chocobo knight and his mount to fight as if they were one mind and one body. They both receive a +2 morale bonus on Attack rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill checks + an additional +2 bonus per four chocobo knight levels after 1st. The mount can full-<wbr />attack after a charge. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chocobo knight levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p><em>Supreme Overrun (Su):</em>&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the chocobo knight and his mount to charge 60 feet in a line, running over his enemies. Enemies within the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per chocobo knight level, a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the chocobo knight&rsquo;s level + his Strength modifier) can half this damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"commanders-aura\">Commander&rsquo;s Aura (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, a chocobo knight can project a commander&rsquo;s aura as a move action, this aura extends 60 feet from the chocobo knight and can be ended as a free action. A chocobo knight can maintain his commander&rsquo;s aura for a number of rounds each day equal to 4 + the chocobo knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier; this duration may be divided in whichever fashion the chocobo knight pleases. At each level after 1st, he can maintain his commander&rsquo;s aura for an additional 2 round per day. Whenever a chocobo knight projects his commander&rsquo;s aura, he can select one of the following aura abilities, providing bonuses to all allies inside the aura. A chocobo knight can spend a swift action to switch the bonus provided by this ability. At 7th level, he can instead use an immediate action to switch the bonus provided by this ability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armored Adage</strong>: All allies gain DR 2/-. At 5th level and every four chocobo knight levels afterwards, this damage reduction increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Buffering Encouragement:</strong> All allies gain temporary hit points equal to the chocobo knight&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier which last until the aura ends. These temporary hit points refresh at the beginning of each of the ally&rsquo;s turns as long as this aura is maintained.</li>\n<li><strong>Defensive Strategum:</strong> All allies gain a +1 morale bonus to their armor class. At 5th level and every four chocobo knight levels afterwards, this morale bonus to their armor class increases by +1.</li>\n<li><strong>Destructive Counsel:</strong> All allies gain a +2 morale bonus to their weapon damage rolls. At 5th level and every four chocobo knight levels afterwards, this morale bonus to weapon damage rolls increases by +2.</li>\n<li><strong>Healing Lesson:</strong> All allies gain fast healing 2. At 4th level and every three chocobo knight levels afterwards, this fast healing increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Resilient Recommendation:</strong> All allies gain 3 points of elemental resistance against one element type (earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind) chosen when the commander&rsquo;s aura is projected. At 4th level and every three chocobo knight levels afterwards, this elemental resistance is increased by 3.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactical Advice:</strong> All allies gain a +1 morale bonus to all combat maneuver checks they make. At 5th level and every four chocobo knight levels afterwards, this morale bonus to combat maneuver checks increases by +1.</li>\n<li><strong>Valiant March:</strong> All allies gain a +10 foot morale bonus to all movement speeds they possess. At 4th level and every three chocobo knight levels afterwards, this morale bonus to movement speed increases by +10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Warding Warning:</strong> All allies gain a +1 morale bonus to all saving throws. At 5th level and every four chocobo knight levels thereafter, this morale bonus to saving throws increases by +1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A commander&rsquo;s aura is a verbal, visual, and mind-affecting morale effect; creatures which cannot see or hear the chocobo knight cannot benefit from it. At 5th level and every four chocobo knight levels afterwards, the area of the commander&rsquo;s aura extends by 10 feet, to a maximum of 100 feet at 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chocobo-mount\">Chocobo Mount (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A chocobo knight gains the service of a loyal and trusty yellow chocobo to carry him into battle. This chocobo functions as a beastmaster&rsquo;s animal companion, using the chocobo knight&rsquo;s level as his effective beastmaster level. A chocobo knight&rsquo;s mount does not gain the shared saves special ability. If a chocobo knight enhances his chocobo mount with <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/chocobo-food/\">chocobo food</a>, all permanent food buffs carry over in advancements. But if the chocobo knight&rsquo;s chocobo mount dies, all permanent food buffs are lost if he summons a new one.<br />Unlike normal chocobos of its kind, a chocobo&rsquo;s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the chocobo knight advances in level. If a character receives a companion from more than one source, his effective chocobo knight levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion.</p>\n<h2

These bonus tricks don&rsquo;t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don&rsquo;t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the chocobo. The chocobo knight selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can&rsquo;t be changed.</li>\n<li><em>Link (Ex):</em>&nbsp;A chocobo knight can handle his companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if he doesn&rsquo;t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill.

The chocobo knight can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. Challenging a foe requires much of the chocobo knight&rsquo;s concentration.

Both the chocobo knight and his mount gain <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mobility-combat-final/\">Mobility</a> as a bonus feat. If the chocobo knight already has this feat, he may pick another Combat feat for which he must meet the prerequisites for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-feeder\">Master Feeder (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, a chocobo knight trains his chocobo mount to eat chocobo food efficiently.

Before making any rolls when using the attack action or the full attack action while mounted on his mount in melee, a chocobo knight may shift points between his attack rolls and his Armor Class. A penalty subtracted from an attack roll applies as a dodge bonus to his AC; a penalty subtracted from Armor Class applies as a bonus on all attack rolls for that round. The points adjusted with the mounted expertise ability may not exceed the chocobo knight&rsquo;s base attack bonus. All changes to attack rolls and AC persist until the chocobo knight&rsquo;s next action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"riders-bond\">Rider&rsquo;s Bond (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, as long as the chocobo knight&rsquo;s mount is above 0 hit points and the chocobo knight is within 60 feet of it, the chocobo knight gains the benefits of the Diehard and Deathless Initiate feats, regardless of if he qualifies for them.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, whenever the chocobo knight would normally be dead due to hit point damage, as long as his mount is still alive and within 60 feet, the chocobo knight can act as though he was still alive, as well as being able to be healed.

This ability doubles the maximum distance the mount can travel when making a charge, up to four times its speed. This ability can be used once per day without penalty to the mount. Each additional use of the ability in a single day requires the mount to make a DC 20 Will save immediately after the conclusion of the charge; failure results in the mount taking 2d6 points of damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"greater-charge\">Greater Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, a chocobo knight learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted.

In addition, the chocobo knight can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip attempt if his charge attack is successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dual-aura\">Dual Aura (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, whenever a chocobo knight projects a commander&rsquo;s aura, he can choose to provide two abilities with his aura without expending additional rounds, rather than just one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"superior-mounted-combat\">Superior Mounted Combat (Ex)</h3>\n<p>After achieving 12th level, a chocobo knight may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) twice per round to negate a successful hit on his mount. At 18th level, the chocobo knight may make these attempts three times per round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"superior-mounted-combat\">Advanced Mounted Talents (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 12th level and every two chocobo knight levels thereafter, a chocobo knight can choose one of the following advanced mounted talents in place of a mounted talent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of advanced mounted talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/chocobo-knight/mounted-talents/#advanced-mounted-talents\">Advanced Mounted Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"chocobos-parry\">Chocobo&rsquo;s Parry (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, a chocobo knight has mastered using his steed to deflect attacks. As an immediate action, a chocobo knight may expend 2 rounds of their commander&rsquo;s aura to attempt a Ride check to turn his mount to absorb the blow for him. The DC of this check is equal to the result of the attack roll made against him. If successful, the attack hits the mount instead, dealing half of its normal damage. A chocobo knight must decide to use this ability after the attack has been rolled, but before the result has been revealed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defensive-charging\">Defensive Charging (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, whenever a mounted chocobo knight charges a foe, his movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, for either him or his mount.</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-the-meek\">Protect the Meek (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, the chocobo knight can move to intercept foes. As an immediate action, he can move up to his speed (or his mount&rsquo;s speed, if mounted) and make a single melee attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The chocobo knight must end his movement adjacent to an enemy. On his next turn, the chocobo knight is staggered and cannot use this ability again for 1 round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"victors-rally\">Victor&rsquo;s Rally (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, the sight of chocobo knight&rsquo;s triumph can inspire his allies to greatness. When a chocobo knight reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the chocobo knight can select an ally (other than themselves or his mount) within the radius of his commander&rsquo;s aura, allowing that ally to either immediately make an attack with a weapon they&rsquo;re wielding or move up to their movement speed (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity). Reducing a creature with fewer HD than half the chocobo knight&rsquo;s level does not activate this effect, and an ally can only be affected by this class feature once every five minutes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"superior-chocobo-mount\">Superior Chocobo Mount (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 15th level, a chocobo knight&rsquo;s chocobo mount is even better trained than before, further enhancing and increasing how often it can use its supernatural abilities. All of the chocobo mount&rsquo;s supernatural abilities have three times as many daily uses rather than double, and gain an additional die on all variable numerical effects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unavoidable-onslaught\">Unavoidable Onslaught (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 16th level, a chocobo knight&rsquo;s mounted charge is not blocked by friendly creatures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"erratic-charge\">Erratic Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, a chocobo knight learns to ride through the thick of combat, striking and then moving away with blinding speed. Whenever the chocobo knight is mounted and takes the charge action, he can first move 10 feet and make a melee attack. This first attack is not a charge, but a regular melee attack, and the movement counts toward the total allowed movement for the round. After making this attack, the chocobo knight must still move in a straight line to reach the target of his charge, and he takes a &ndash;5 penalty on the attack roll for the attack at the end of his charge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"generals-awe\">General&rsquo;s Awe (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, whenever a chocobo knight is riding his mount, he can spend 4 rounds of his commander&rsquo;s aura as a free action while making an attack. If the attack is successful, the attacked creature must make a successful Will saving throw (DC 10 + half of the chocobo knight&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned for 1 round.</p>\n<p>In addition, for a number of rounds equal to the chocobo knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, at the beginning of each of the creature&rsquo;s turns, it must make an additional successful Will saving throw or be unable to make an attack targeting the chocobo knight or his mount. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This second effect is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spiritual-bond\">Spiritual Bond (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 18th level, the chocobo knight can grant his mount temporary hit points equal to his chocobo knight level once per day. While these temporary hit points last, when his mount is within 30 feet of him, he can choose to take the damage taken by his mount. The chocobo knight cannot take damage using this feature, if under the secondary effect of Rider&rsquo;s Bond.</p>\n<h3 id=\"indomitable-steed\">Indomitable Steed (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, a chocobo knight and his steed gain DR 5/&mdash; when mounted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supreme-charge\">Supreme Charge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, whenever the chocobo knight makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the chocobo knight confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to dazed for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the chocobo knight&rsquo;s base attack bonus.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.
