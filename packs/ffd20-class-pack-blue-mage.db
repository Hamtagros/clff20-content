Their motto is &ldquo;fight fire with fire.&rdquo; When not performing undercover missions, or adventuring in an area where doing so would endanger them unnecessarily, they prefer to wear blue&mdash;they claim that this is the color of monsters&rsquo; souls. Blue mages are invariably those who have had close calls with monsters and learned from them, intuitively figuring out how to predict, evade, and finally replicate monsters&rsquo; attacks. The Azure Academy observes particularly observant adventurers and attempts to recruit the cream of the crop. After training for at least a month at the Academy&rsquo;s headquarters, a new recruit is ready to go out and begin amassing his own arsenal of monster techniques.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Blue mages has a unique set of skills and spells to provide tactical support over the battleground.

Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Blue mages are proficient with all simple weapons including longswords, sword canes, all power weapons (melee and ranged), and scimitars. Blue mages are proficient with light armor and light shields but can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the blue mage receives the Limit Breaks (Dual Azure Mastery and Scan Master).</p>\n<p><em>Dual Azure Mastery (Su):</em> This Limit Break allows the blue mage for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four blue mage levels after 1st to cast two blue magic spells a round as a standard action. MP must be paid for both spells. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p><em>Scan Master (Su):</em> This Limit Break coats the eyes of the blue mage with displays and integral information about all beasts she looks upon. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four blue mage levels after 1st, the blue mage can identify the elemental weaknesses, elemental resistances, elemental absorption, and elemental immunities of her foes, she also reduces their effectiveness by 1 stage (Absorb &gt; Immunity &gt; Resistance 20 &gt; No Resistance &gt; Weakness) for the duration with her attacks and blue mage spells. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3>Creature Magic</h3>\n<p>A blue mage has the power to gain new spells from creatures that have supernatural abilities by learning from them. The blue mage must witness the creature use its abilities for the blue mage to learn by making an appropriate Knowledge (see below) skill check or learn by being struck by the ability (she learns the spell automatically if she is struck by the spell, even if she makes a save), she cannot learn by observing blue mage spells via the use of wondrous items or being cast by another blue mage. The initial skill check is DC 15 + 2 per spell level of the ability. A blue mage begins play with 2 1st level blue mage spells of her choice. Each time a character attains a new blue mage level, she gains one spell of her choice to add to her list of spells (the free spell must be of a spell level she can cast). In addition, if a blue mage is created after 1st level, she gains 1 more spell chosen at random for each level at the highest spell level for each blue mage level. Unlike the other mages, a blue mage cannot purchase or find scrolls to add spells to her spells known list, but she can learn new blue mage spells from another blue mage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcana (dragons, magical beasts)</li>\n<li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, oozes)</li>\n<li>Engineering or Technology (constructs)</li>\n<li>Local (humanoids, monstrous humanoids)</li>\n<li>Nature (animals, fey, plants, vermin)</li>\n<li>Planes (outsiders)</li>\n<li>Religion (undead)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once learned, the ability becomes a spell in the <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/blue-mage/\">blue mage&rsquo;s known spells list</a>. See the monster&rsquo;s description to find out the spell level of a creature&rsquo;s supernatural abilities. The blue mage can learn spells above her spell level, but cannot cast those spells until she has attain the level to be able to cast them. The only limitation to this is the blue mage cannot learn Limit Breaks through the use of this ability. Any supernatural abilities learned through this ability that doesn&rsquo;t have a duration will have a duration of 1 round per blue mage level. When a blue mage casts a spell that is always centered on herself, and is either a burst, spread, or has a radius, she may exclude herself from its effects.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, the blue mage must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 11 for 1st-<wbr />level spells, Int 12 for 2nd-<wbr />level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a blue mage&rsquo;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the blue mage&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. In addition, a blue mage gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Intelligence&mdash;see&nbsp;<strong>Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)</strong> on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"blue-magery\">Blue Magery (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level and every four blue mage levels thereafter, a blue mage increases her power with her spells of 1st level or higher. This ability applies only to spells that she casts as a <span lang=\"en-US\">blue mage, not to those she might have by virtue of levels in another class. At each such opportunity, she can choose from the list of the following (with a maximum of 2 per):</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Analysis Mastery:</em>&nbsp;This grants a +2 bonus to Knowledge checks for Analysis abilities. The first time the blue mage chooses this ability, Analysis requires only a move action to use. The second time the blue mage chooses this ability, Analysis requires only a swift action to use.</li>\n<li><em>Creature Knowledge Mastery:</em>&nbsp;This provides a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws from creatures that have been&nbsp;<em>Scanned.</em>&nbsp;In addition, the blue mage may reroll any failed Knowledge check once per round.</li>\n<li><em>Natural Prowess:</em>&nbsp;This increases the blue mage&rsquo;s ability to hit with his natural weapons granted by Azure Physical Training by +2. In addition, the blue mage&rsquo;s damage with his Azure Physical Training natural weapons improves by one step.</li>\n<li><em>Obscure Spell Mastery:</em>&nbsp;This increases the DC for all of the blue mage&rsquo;s spells by 1 as well as increases the difficulty in identifying her spells via Spellcraft skill by 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Blue mages are considered to have the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a> feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Blue mages learn a number of cantrips, or 0-<wbr />level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Blue mages begin with 4 0-<wbr />level spells and gain an additional 0-<wbr />level spell every three levels after 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scan\">Scan (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, as a swift action, the blue mage can scan a creature within 60 feet to find out if it has a supernatural ability she can learn from. <span lang=\"en-US\">The blue mage must make a DC 20 Knowledge (of the appropriate type) skill check to know what abilities can be learned.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mage-talents\">Azure Talents</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">As a blue mage gains experience, she learns a number of talents that assist her in manipulating spells and other forms of magic. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, a blue mage gains one azure talent. A blue mage cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a blue mage&rsquo;s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of azure talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/blue-mage/azure-talents/\">Azure Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"armored-mage\">Armored Mage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, normally, <span data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">armor of any kind interferes with a spell-<wbr />caster&rsquo;s gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A blue mage&rsquo;s limited focus and specialized training, however, allows her to avoid spell failure so long as she sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium armor or heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spell-<wbr />casting class.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"analysis\">Analysis (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, usable per day equal to 3 + the blue mage&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier, a blue mage can draw upon her intuitive ability to read a creature&rsquo;s essence, granting her and her allies benefits against the creatures they face. Using <em>analysis</em>&nbsp;abilities require a standard action which doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. A blue mage unlocks new&nbsp;<em>analysis</em>&nbsp;abilities as her level increases. The blue mage&rsquo;s analysis can affect a single creature or all creatures of the same race, depending on the effect used. A target creature must be within 60 feet, and the blue mage must be aware of the creature&rsquo;s presence, although she need not have a line of sight to it. The effects of analysis last for 1 round per blue mage level, unless stated otherwise. To affect her allies, they must be within 30 feet of the blue mage. Using&nbsp;<em>analysis</em>&nbsp;requires an appropriate Knowledge skill check DC 10 + the CR of the creature.&nbsp;<em>Analysis</em>&nbsp;can only be used once against any given creature per encounter.</p>\n<p><em>Lucubrate (Ex):</em>&nbsp;The blue mage learns the general combat behaviors of creatures of that race, granting her allies a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls made against them. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 5 or more, then this bonus increases to +2. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 10 or more, then this bonus increases to +3. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 20 or more, then this bonus increases to +4.</p>\n<p><em>Mettle (Ex):</em> Starting at 7th level, the blue mage can use her analysis to help her allies fight off the dangerous abilities of other creatures. Allies within 30 feet of the blue mage gain a +1 competence bonus on saving throws against the affected creature&rsquo;s abilities. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 5 or more, then this bonus increases to +2. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 10 or more, then this bonus increases to +3. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 20 or more, then this bonus increases to +4.</p>\n<p><em>Foreknowledge (Su):</em> Starting at 11th level, a blue mage can teach her allies how to avoid attacks from the target creature. Unlike other analysis abilities, this ability can be used only against a single creature. On a successful Knowledge check, she grants them a +1 dodge bonus to AC against that creature. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 5 or more, then this bonus increases to +2 AC. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 10 or more, then this bonus increases to +3 AC. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 20 or more, then this bonus increases to +4 AC.</p>\n<p><em>Flummox (Su):</em> By raking the essence of the target creature, a blue mage of 15th level or higher can dazzle a target creature for 1 round. Like the <em>Foreknowledge</em> ability, flummox can be used only against a single creature. On a successful Knowledge check, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 5 or more, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + Intelligence modifier) or be affected by the Immobilize status for 1 round. If the blue mage succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + Intelligence modifier) or be affected by the Disable status for 1 round. If the blue mage succeeds on his Knowledge check by 20 or more, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + Intelligence modifier) or be stunned for 1 round.</p>\n<p><em>Puissance (Ex):</em> Starting at 19th level, a blue mage can direct her allies to attack vital spots of her enemies. On a successful Knowledge check, she grants them a bonus to damage rolls made against the target creatures equal to 1d6 points of damage. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 5 or more, then this bonus increases to 2d6. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 10 or more, then this bonus increases to 3d6. If the blue mage succeeds on her Knowledge check by 20 or more, then this bonus increases to 4d6. Creatures that are immune to critical hits, are also immune to this ability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"azure-physical-training\">Azure Physical Training (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a blue mage gains abilities that emulate physical attacks of creatures. The blue mage can use these abilities at will.</p>\n<p><em>Slam (Ex):</em>&nbsp;The blue mage emulates a slam of a construct. The slam deals 1d4 (1d3 for small size, 1d6 for large size) points of damage + Strength modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Bite (Ex):</em>&nbsp;At 8th level, the blue mage emulates the bite of a wolf. The bite deals 1d6 (1d4 for small size, 1d8 for large size) points of damage + Strength modifier. If the blue mage hits with the bite attack, she can attempt to trip combat maneuver as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the blue mage.</p>\n<p><em>Grab (Ex):</em>&nbsp;At 12th level, the blue mage emulates the grab of a bear. If the blue mage hits with a slam or bite attack, she can attempt to start a grapple combat maneuver as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. This grab ability works only opponents that are at least her size category or smaller. The blue mage can then crush an opponent, dealing 1d6 (1d4 for small size, 1d8 for large size) points of damage + Strength modifier, after making a successful grapple combat maneuver per round.</p>\n<p><em>Powerful Charge (Ex):</em>&nbsp;At 16th level, the blue mage emulates the charge of a rhinoceros. The blue mage deals 1d8 (1d6 for small size, 1d10 for large size) points of damage + Strength modifier when she makes a charge.</p>\n<p><em>Pounce (Ex):</em>&nbsp;At 20th level, the blue mage emulates the pounce of a lion. When the blue mage makes a charge, it can follow up with a full attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">At 5th level, a blue mage can regain her MP quicker. The blue mage must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, she could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The blue mage does not gain this recovery if she is asleep or unconscious. The blue mage regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five blue mage levels after 5th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"azure-training\">Azure Learning (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, the blue mage receives a +1 bonus on all Knowledge checks. This bonus increases by +1 every five levels thereafter, to a maximum of a +4 bonus at 20th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"invoke\">Invoke (Su)</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">At 6th level, the blue mage can invoke a creature to use its spell-like or supernatural ability. The blue mage must know what the creature possesses for abilities by using the <em>scan</em> ability. If a creature has more than one ability, the blue mage can decide which one she wants the creature to use. The creature gets a Will save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) to negate this ability, if it fails, on its next turn, it will use its ability. This ability has a range of 60 feet and requires a move action which doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. This is a <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a> effect.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, the blue mage&rsquo;s ability to invoke a creature to use its abilities improves. The blue mage can use this ability as a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"refined-knowledge\">Refined Knowledge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, the blue mage can tap into her expanded knowledge about her enemies. Whenever the blue mage rolls a Knowledge skill check to identify a creature, she may roll twice and takes the better result. If the blue mage has Knowledge skill unlock at 20 ranks, she, instead, rolls thrice and takes the better result.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-know-that-trick\">I Know That Trick (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, the blue mage gains a +1 bonus to her saving throws against any ability that she has learned as a blue magic spell. This bonus increases by +1 for every three additional blue mage levels beyond 7th level (+2 at 10th level, +3 at 13th, +4 at 16th, and +5 at 19th).</p>\n<h3 id=\"azure-counter\">Azure Counter (Su)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, a blue mage can attempt to counter a monster&rsquo;s special attack. If the blue mage knows the blue magic spell and has a readied action, she may make a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the monster&rsquo;s CR. If she succeeds, the monster loses its action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"libra\">Libra (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, the blue mage can analyze a creature to find how much (current) hit points, (current) magic points, damage reduction, any resistances, and any weaknesses it possesses. A creature can resist the effects by making a Will save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier). This ability has a range of 60 feet and requires a move action which doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"simulation\">Simulation (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, the blue mage can copy any special qualities from creatures she has used the&nbsp;<em>Libra&nbsp;</em>ability on. As a standard action, usable per day equal to the blue mage&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier, the blue mage may copy only one special quality from a creature at a time. The only special quality ability that cannot be copied is the creature type. Copying a creature&rsquo;s special qualities overrides her own. For example, if a blue mage copies the damage reduction, it replaces her own damage reduction if she had any. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the blue mage&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-mage-talents\">Advanced Azure Talents</h3>\n<p class=\"western\">At 12th, and every two levels thereafter, a blue mage learns further talents to assist her in manipulating spells and other forms of magic. She may choose one of the following advanced azure talents in place of an azure talent. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a blue mage&rsquo;s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of advanced azure talents can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/blue-mage/azure-talents/#advanced-azure-talents\">Advanced Azure Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"easy-learning\">Easy Learning (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, the blue mage can take 10 on all Knowledge checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doublecast\">Doublecast (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, a blue mage can cast two spells using one standard action. Both of the spells must have the same standard action casting time. The blue mage can make any decisions concerning the spells independently of each other. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a &ndash;4 penalty on saves made against each spell. A blue mage receives a +4 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. The blue mage may use this ability once per day at 15th level and one additional time per day at 20th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"azure-lore\">Azure Lore (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, three times per day, as a swift action, a blue mage may apply any single metamagic feat that she knows to a 6th-level blue magic spell or lower that she is about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the MP cost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-mp-spell\">1 MP Spell (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 18th level, three times per day, as a free action, a blue mage can reduce the cost of her next spell to 1 MP. The use of this ability cannot be used with metamagic feats.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cerulean-focus\">Cerulean Focus (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, the blue mage increases the DC for every blue magic spell she casts by 1. She also adds this bonus to caster level checks made using her azure counter ability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"assimilation\">Assimilation (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, the blue mage absorb any special qualities from creatures she has used the&nbsp;<em>Libra&nbsp;</em>ability on. As a standard action, usable per day equal to the blue mage&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier, the blue mage may absorb only one special quality from a creature at a time. A creature affected by this ability must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the blue mage&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or temporary loses its special quality ability. The only special quality ability that cannot be absorbed is the creature type. Absorbing a creature&rsquo;s special qualities overrides her own. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the blue mage&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. In addition, the blue mage learns the special quality ability and may be reused at any given time with a successful appropriate Knowledge skill check of DC 15 + the CR of the creature that uses up an assimilation ability usage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"pagebreak\">Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.
