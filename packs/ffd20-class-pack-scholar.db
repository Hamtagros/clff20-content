Features</h2>\n<p>All of the following are class features of the scholar.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Scholars are proficient with the dagger, sling, power rod, power staff, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Heavier armor interferes with a scholar&rsquo;s movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the scholar receives the Limit Breaks (From Dusk Til Dawn and Tabula Rasa).</p>\n<p>From Dusk Til Dawn (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the scholar to use any White Mage Limit Break while under Light Arts and any Black Mage Limit Break while under Dark Arts. If a limit break has a duration, it lasts for 1 round + 1 round per four scholar levels after 1st. Action required for this limit break is copied from the limit break the scholar has chosen.</p>\n<p>Tabula Rasa (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the scholar to use both Light Arts and Dark Arts with all the bonuses but without penalties for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four scholar levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n<p>A scholar casts black magic and white magic spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/black-mage/\">black mage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/white-mage/\">white mage</a>&nbsp;spell lists. A scholar begins play with 2 1st level black magic spells and 2 1st level white magic spells of her choice. The scholar also selects a number of additional 1st-level black magic spells equal to her Intelligence modifier and a number of additional 1st-level white magic spells equal to her Wisdom modifier to add to her list of spells. Each time a character attains a new scholar level, she gains two black magic and two white magic spells of her choice to add to her list of spells. These free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. Like most mages, a scholar can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a black magic spell, the scholar must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 11 for 1st-level spells, Int 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a scholar&rsquo;s black magic spell is 10 + the spell level + the scholar&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. In addition, a scholar gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Intelligence).</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a white magic spell, the scholar must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a scholar&rsquo;s white magic spell is 10 + the spell level + the scholar&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. In addition, a scholar gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom).</p>\n<h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Scholars are considered to have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a>&nbsp;feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Scholars learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Scholars begin with 2 0-level spells from either the black mage or white mage spell list and gain an additional 0-level spell every four levels after 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grimoire\">Grimoire (Su)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 1st level, books and tomes become deadly weapons in the hands of a scholar. Functioning only in the hands of a scholar, a book or tome read by a scholar deals 1d4 + Intelligence modifier points of shadow damage while under Dark Arts and 1d4 + Wisdom modifier points of holy damage while under Light Arts. The scholar must make a ranged touch attack that has a range of 25 feet + 5 feet per two scholar levels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arcane-hypothesis\">Arcane Hypothesis (Su)</h3>\n<p>Not just knowledgeable with spells, a scholar experiments constantly in order to better hersel<span lang=\"en-US\">f</span>&nbsp;at wielding magic, and see what she can create. At 1st level, by increasing a spell&rsquo;s casting time (swift/immediate to standard action, standard action or less to full-round action, full-round action to 1 round, 1 round to 2 rounds, or double any longer casting time), the scholar can roll on the table below and add the resulting metamagic feat to the spell without increasing the MP cost of the spell.</p>\n<p>Use of this ability must be declared before the spell to be affected is cast. First, the scholar selects the spell to be modified. Then she rolls on the Arcane Hypothesis table. If the resulting metamagic cannot be applied to the selected spell, she must roll again until it can (she only rerolls if the resulting dice cannot be adjusted). Lastly, the scholar casts the resulting spell as normal, choosing targets, making attack rolls, etc. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier or her Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher.</p>\n<table id=\"tablepress-769\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d%</th>\n<th>Meta Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01-35</td>\n<td>Apocalyptic Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36-55</td>\n<td>Extend Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>56-75</td>\n<td>Empower Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>76-90</td>\n<td>Maximize Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91-95</td>\n<td>Widen Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>96-100</td>\n<td>Chain Spell</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At 3rd level, the scholar can adjust her roll result on the table above. She may increase, or decrease, the roll result by 3 points per two scholar levels after 1st in order to adjust the meta effect to a more desirable result.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, the scholar can roll twice on the table above, and select one of the two metamagic effects to apply to that spell. She can still adjust the result of each roll to get a more desired result.</p>\n<h3 id=\"light-arts-dark-arts\">Light Arts/Dark Arts (Su)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, as a standard action, a scholar can activate or deactivate the Light Arts or Dark Arts. She may only use Light Arts or Dark Arts abilities while in the Light/Dark Arts. While in either Light/Dark Arts, she gains the bonuses as dictated in the &ldquo;Bonuses&rdquo; column of the following table, but she also has penalties when casting spells associated with the opposite art. The bonus/penalty from this ability applies only to spells that she casts as a scholar, not to those she might have by virtue of levels in another class. This is indicated in the &ldquo;Penalties&rdquo; column of the following table:</p>\n<h2 id=\"tablepress-258-name\">Table: Light Arts/Dark Arts Bonuses</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-258\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" aria-labelledby=\"tablepress-258-name\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current Form</th>\n<th>Bonuses</th>\n<th>Penalties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Arts</td>\n<td>All healing spells are increased by 1 extra die of the appropriate type.<br /><br />All enhancing spells with variable durations are increased by 1 + 1 per four scholar levels after 1st.<br /><br />All light spells' caster level are increased by 1 + 1 per four scholar levels after 1st.<br /><br />The save DC for all white magic spells is increased by 1 + 1 per four scholar levels after 1st.<br /><br />The caster level checks made to overcome a creature's spell resistance is increased by 1 + 1 per four scholar levels after 1st for white magic spells.</td>\n<td>All elemental spells are decreased by 1 die of the appropriate type to a minimum of 1.

At 13th level, a scholar can switch between Light Arts and Dark Arts as a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arcane-reservoir\">Arcane Reservoir (Su)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 2nd level, a scholar has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her scholar exploits and enhance her spells. The scholar&rsquo;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the scholar&rsquo;s level. Each day, after resting 8 hours, the scholar&rsquo;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + half of her scholar&rsquo;s level. She can also regain these points through the consume MP class feature and some scholar exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>\n<p>Points from the scholar reservoir are used to fuel many of the scholar&rsquo;s powers. In addition, the scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts a spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&rsquo;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scholar-exploits\">Scholar Exploits</h3>\n<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the scholar learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the scholar learns a new scholar exploit selected from the following list. A scholar exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once a scholar exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most scholar exploits require the scholar to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for a scholar exploit is equal to 10 + half of the scholar&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of scholar exploits can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/scholar/scholar-exploits/\">Scholar Exploits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"penury\">Light Arts: Penury (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, 3 times per day, as a move action, a scholar may reduce the MP cost of her next White Magic spell to 0. This MP reduction is applied after any metamagic cost increases. Additional metamagic cannot be applied after this cost reduction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"parsimony\">Dark Arts: Parsimony (Su)</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, 3 times per day, as a move action, a scholar may reduce the MP cost of her next Black Magic spell to 0. This MP reduction is applied after any metamagic cost increases. Additional metamagic cannot be applied after this cost reduction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a scholar can regain her MP quicker. The scholar must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, she could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The scholar does not gain this recovery if she is asleep or unconscious. The scholar regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five scholar levels after 5th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consume-mp\">Consume MP (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a scholar can expend MP up to the maximum she can spend as a move action. Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to MP consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&rsquo;s maximum are lost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"refined-knowledge\">Refined Knowledge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, the scholar can tap into her expanded knowledge about her enemies. Whenever the scholar rolls a Knowledge skill check to identify a creature, she may roll twice and takes the better result. If the scholar has Knowledge skill unlock at 20 ranks, she, instead, rolls thrice and takes the better result.</p>\n<h3 id=\"accession\">Light Arts: Accession (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, 3 times per day, as a move action, a scholar may double the duration of her next Enhancing White Magic spell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manifestation\">Dark Arts: Manifestation (Su)</h3>\n<p>Also at 7th level, 3 times per day, as a move action, a scholar may double the duration of her next Enfeebling Black Magic spell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eldritch-surge\">Eldritch Surge (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, a scholar can, as a swift action, pour more power into her spells and abilities. She can add 2 to the caster level and DC of a spell, or increase her effective scholar level by 2 when using a scholar exploit. She becomes fatigued upon using this ability. If she is already fatigued, she becomes exhausted. If she&rsquo;s already exhausted, or something would prevent her from becoming fatigued or exhausted, she cannot use this ability. This ability does not stack with spending points from her arcane reservoir to increase the spell&rsquo;s caster level or DC (as the arcane reservoir class feature).</p>\n<h3 id=\"submination\">Sublimation (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, 3 times per day, as a swift action, a scholar may activate this ability which lasts 1 round per scholar level. Each round, the scholar is drained of 4 HPs and gains 1 MP. Once activated, it cannot be stopped and either runs its course, or the caster falls unconscious, which cancels this ability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"celerity\">Light Arts: Celerity (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, 3 times per day, a scholar may cast a White Magic spell as a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alacrity\">Dark Arts: Alacrity (Su)</h3>\n<p>Also at 11th level, 3 times per day, a scholar may cast a Black Magic spell as a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-scholar-exploits\">Advanced Scholar Exploits</h3>\n<p>At 12th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a scholar can choose one of the following advanced scholar exploits in place of a scholar exploit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of advanced scholar exploits can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/scholar/scholar-exploits/#advanced-scholar-exploits\">Advanced Scholar Exploits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"improved-surge\">Improved Surge (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, a scholar can use her eldritch surge ability to reroll an attack roll associated with a spell or scholar exploit, or to reroll all of the damage dice associated with a spell or scholar exploit. In the case of attack rolls, this ability must be used after the die is rolled but before the results are revealed. The scholar must take the results of the reroll, even if they are lower.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rapture\">Light Arts: Rapture (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, 3 times per day, as a move action, a scholar may maximize her next healing type white magic spell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ebullience\">Dark Arts: Ebullience (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, 3 times per day, as a move action, a scholar may maximize her next elemental type black magic spell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"greater-surge\">Greater Surge (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, a scholar can use her eldritch surge ability to force a creature to reroll a saving throw against one spell or scholar exploit and take the lower value. The scholar must declare the use of this ability before the result of that creature&rsquo;s saving throw is revealed. If the spell or scholar exploit affects more than one target, only one target is affected by this ability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bottomless-well\">Bottomless Well (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, a scholar can spend 1 hour studying her grimoire to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to regain MP as if resting for 8 hours and regain points of arcane reservoir equal to half her scholar level. She can use this ability multiple times per day, however she still only regains MP once per day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"magical-supremacy\">Magical Supremacy (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, the scholar learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she knows by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending MP. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way nor can metamagic feats be applied.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have scholar as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\">Dwarf</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/4 to the scholar&rsquo;s effective class level when determining the effects of the arcane barrier and arcane grimoire scholar exploits.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/elvaan/\">Elvaan</a>:&nbsp;Increase total number of points in the scholar&rsquo;s arcane reservoir by 1.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/galka/\">Galka</a>:&nbsp;Gain a +1 bonus on concentration checks made due to taking damage while casting spells.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/guado/\">Guado</a>:&nbsp;The scholar gains +1/6th of a scholar exploit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/half-breed/\">Half-Breed</a>:&nbsp;When casting&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">scholar enfeebling</span>&nbsp;spells, add 1/3 to the effective caster level, but only for the purpose of determining duration.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/hume/\">Hume</a>:&nbsp;Add one spell from the black mage or white mage spell lists to the scholar&rsquo;s known spells. The spell must be at least 1 spell level below the highest level the scholar can cast.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/kojin/\">Kojin</a>:&nbsp;Add 1 spell from the black mage or white mage spell lists to the scholar&rsquo;s known spells.

This option has no effect unless the scholar has selected it twice (or possesses increments evenly divisible by 5); a distance of 12.5 feet is effectively the same as a distance of 10 feet, for example.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/moogle/\">Moogle</a>:&nbsp;Gain 1/6 of a new scholar exploit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/nu-mou/\">Nu Mou</a>:&nbsp;Increase total number of points in the scholar&rsquo;s arcane reservoir by 1.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/sylph/\">Sylph</a>:&nbsp;Increase total number of points in the scholar&rsquo;s arcane reservoir by 1.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/tarutaru/\">Tarutaru</a>: Add 1/6 to the number of points the scholar gains in her arcane reservoir each day.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"dagger;sling;power rod;power staff;quarterstaff"},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"classType":"base","levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"dri":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"kte":true,"lin":true,"nav":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pil":false,"pro":true,"rep":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"classSubType":"hybrid","parentclass":"","countforexp":"exp","classBaseMPTypes":"pacman","classCastingStat":"intAndWis","classBaseMPauto":"yes","mp":null,"conditionals":[],"identifiedName":"Scholar"},"flags":{},"img":"modules/ffd20-content/images/Scholar.png","effects":[]}
