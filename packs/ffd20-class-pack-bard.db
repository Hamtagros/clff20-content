Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor but not with any shields.</p>\n<p>Because the somatic components required for bard songs are relatively simple, a bard can perform songs while wearing light armor without incurring the normal song failure chance. However, like mages, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of song failure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the bard receives the Limit Breaks (Auric Beauty and Soul Voice).</p>\n<p>Auric Beauty (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break causes the bard to enhance his auras beyond their normal power. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four bard levels after 1st, the bard&rsquo;s auras have their radius increases by 15 feet (this is also doubled with Improved Aura) as well as allow the bard to project an additional minor or major aura at the same time as his current active auras, this additional aura does not count against his daily uses. The bard can maintain an additional minor or major aura at a time at 10th level and then at 20th level. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p>Soul Voice (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the bard to be able perform songs with perfect efficiency. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four bard levels after 1st, the bard can select one song each round started and performed during the limit break that has all variables and effects maximized and doubled. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"songs\">Songs</h3>\n<p>A bard performs songs from his songbook, in which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/bard/\">bard song list</a>. Unlike mages, bards keep a written account of his songs in his songbook. A bard begins play with 3 1st level bard songs of his choice. The bard also selects a number of additional 1st-level songs equal to his Charisma modifier to add to his songbook. Each time a character attains a new bard level, he gains two songs of his choice to add to his songbook. The two free songs must be of song levels he can perform.&nbsp;But like mages, the bard can also purchase songs for his songbook.</p>\n<p>To learn or perform a song, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the song level (Cha 11 for 1st-<wbr />level songs, Cha 12 for 2nd-<wbr />level songs, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard&rsquo;s song is 10 + the song&rsquo;s level + the bard&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. In addition, a bard gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Charisma&mdash;see&nbsp;Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p>\n<p>Performing a song also requires the bard to make a Perform skill check of DC 10 + twice the song&rsquo;s level in addition to spending MP. Failure in making the skill check still expends the MP cost of the song. Performing a song provokes an attack of opportunity and require concentration checks as if they were spells. All songs have a duration of one round + the bard&rsquo;s Charisma modifier and are dismissible with a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The bard may do other things while the song duration is in effect, including other songs to a maximum allowed by their Additional Song ability and only 1 song per round. Most songs have a radius of 30 feet, centered on the bard, unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-jingles\">Jingles</h3>\n<p>Bards learn a number of jingles, or 0-<wbr />level songs. These songs do not require the Perform skill like any other song, nor do they take up a song slot, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Bards begin with 2 jingles and gain an additional jingle&nbsp;every four levels after 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"musical-power\">Musical Power (Su)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, a bard can use any musical instrument and empower it. As a standard action, the musical instrument requires a ranged touch attack and it deals non-elemental damage equal to 1d4 + his Charisma modifier at a range of 25 feet + 5 feet per two bard levels. Any enhancement/enchantment placed onto their instrument also applies with this attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"auras\">Auras (Su)</h3>\n<p>The bard exerts an effect on allies in his vicinity. He can learn to produce different effects, or auras, over the course of his career. The bard may project one minor aura and (starting at 4th level) one major aura at a time. Projecting an aura is a swift action. The aura remains in effect until the bard uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A bard can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the bard takes his first turn. Activating an aura involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A bard sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do their best. Unless otherwise noted, a bard&rsquo;s aura affects all allies within 15 feet (including himself) who can hear the bard, if an ally leaves the aura they immediately lose the effects. Auras are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#language-dependent\">language-dependent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>, an ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be able to understand the bard&rsquo;s language to gain the bonus. A bard&rsquo;s aura is dismissed if he is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by his allies. A bard begins play knowing one minor aura of his choice. As his bard level increases, he gains access to new auras, as indicated on Table 3&ndash;4: The Bard. All bonuses granted by a bard&rsquo;s auras are morale bonuses that do not stack with each other. The bards gain uses of his auras per day equal to 3 + his bard level, minor auras take 1 use whereas major auras take 2 uses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"minor-auras\">Minor Aura (Su)</h3>\n<p>A minor aura lets allies add the bard&rsquo;s Charisma modifier up to the bard&rsquo;s level (if any) to certain rolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurate Strike:&nbsp;Bonus on rolls made to confirm critical hits.</li>\n<li>Art of War:&nbsp;Bonus on disarm, trip, bull rush, and sunder combat maneuvers.</li>\n<li>Demand Fortitude:&nbsp;Bonus on Fortitude saves.</li>\n<li>Determined Caster:&nbsp;Bonus on rolls to overcome spell resistance.</li>\n<li>Force of Will:&nbsp;Bonus on Will saves.</li>\n<li>Master of Opportunity:&nbsp;Bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity.</li>\n<li>Master of Tactics:&nbsp;Bonus on damage rolls when flanking.</li>\n<li>Motivate Charisma:&nbsp;Bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-<wbr />based skill checks.</li>\n<li>Motivate Constitution:&nbsp;Bonus on Constitution checks and Constitution-<wbr />based skill checks.</li>\n<li>Motivate Dexterity:&nbsp;Bonus on Dexterity checks and Dexterity-<wbr />based skill checks.</li>\n<li>Motivate Intelligence:&nbsp;Bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-<wbr />based skill checks.</li>\n<li>Motivate Strength:&nbsp;Bonus on Strength checks and Strength-<wbr />based skill checks.</li>\n<li>Motivate Wisdom:&nbsp;Bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-<wbr />based skill checks.</li>\n<li>Over the Top:&nbsp;Bonus on damage rolls when charging.</li>\n<li>Watchful Eye:&nbsp;Bonus on Reflex saves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bardic-performance\">Bardic Performance (Su)</h3>\n<p>A bard is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.</p>\n<p>Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.</p>\n<p>Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.</p>\n<p>List of Bardic Performances:</p>\n<p>Countersong (Su):&nbsp;At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal components.) Each round of the countersong he makes a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-<wbr />dependent magical attack may use the bard&rsquo;s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-<wbr />instantaneous sonic or language-<wbr />dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard&rsquo;s Perform skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don&rsquo;t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</p>\n<p>Distraction (Su):&nbsp;At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an illusion magical attack may use the bard&rsquo;s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the Distraction is already under the effect of a non-<wbr />instantaneous illusion magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the Distraction, but it must use the bard&rsquo;s Perform check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don&rsquo;t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.</p>\n<p>Fascinate (Su):&nbsp;At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The Distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + half the bard&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.</p>\n<p>Inspire Courage (Su):&nbsp;A 1st level bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the bard&rsquo;s performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose which component to use when starting his performance.</p>\n<p>Inspire Competence (Su):&nbsp;A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he continues to hear the bard&rsquo;s performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th). Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. A bard can&rsquo;t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.</p>\n<p>Inspire Greatness (Su):&nbsp;A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level). To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target&rsquo;s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability and it relies on audible and visual components.</p>\n<p>Soothing Performance (Su):&nbsp;A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the&nbsp;cura&nbsp;spell, using the bard&rsquo;s level as the caster level. In addition, this performance removes the fatigued, sickened, and shaken condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.</p>\n<p>Frightening Tune (Sp):&nbsp;A bard of 14th level or higher can use his performance to cause fear in his enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + half of the bard&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the target becomes frightened and flees for as long as the target can hear the bard&rsquo;s performance. Frightening tune relies on audible components. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;effect.</p>\n<p>Inspire Heroics (Su):&nbsp;A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability that relies on audible and visual components.</p>\n<p>Funeral Ballad (Su):&nbsp;Once per day, a bard of 18th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to Arise on a dead creature, using the bard&rsquo;s level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 10 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be within 10 feet of the bard for the entire performance. Funeral ballad relies on audible and visual components.</p>\n<p>Deadly Performance (Su):&nbsp;A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to cause one enemy to die from joy or sorrow. To be affected, the target must be able to see and hear the bard perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + half of the bard&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw succeeds, the target is dazed for 1d4 rounds, and the bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for 24 hours. If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw fails, it dies. Deadly performance is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;death effect that relies on audible and visual components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"well-versed\">Well-Versed (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. The bard gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#sonic\">sonic</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#language-dependent\">language-dependent</a>&nbsp;effects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-versatile-performance\">Versatile Performance (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, a bard can choose one type of Perform skill. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill&rsquo;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>\n<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Act (Bluff, Disguise), Comedy (Bluff, Intimidate), Dance (Acrobatics, Fly), Keyboard Instruments (Diplomacy, Intimidate), Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>\n<h3 id=\"inspiration\">Inspiration (Su)</h3>\n<p>During battle, the bard exhorts his comrades with words of courage and determination. This inspiration affects all allies within a 30-<wbr />foot radius centered on the bard, and bestows 1d6 temporary hit points, plus 1d6 additional points for every two bard levels beyond 2nd (2d6 at 4th, 3d6 at 6th, and so on) These temporary hit points last until the battle ends, or until they are removed through damage. A bard may inspire a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. This is a move action and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The bard can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#language-dependent\">language-dependent</a>&nbsp;ability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"song-talents\">Song Talents (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>As a b<span lang=\"en-US\">ard</span>&nbsp;gains experience, he learns a number of talents that assist him in manipulating&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">his songs and class features</span>. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, a b<span lang=\"en-US\">ard</span>&nbsp;gains one&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">song</span>&nbsp;talent. A b<span lang=\"en-US\">ard</span>&nbsp;cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a b<span lang=\"en-US\">ard</span>&rsquo;s s<span lang=\"en-US\">ong-performing</span>&nbsp;ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual s<span lang=\"en-US\">ong</span>&nbsp;and the decision must be made before the s<span lang=\"en-US\">ong</span>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">performed</span>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of song talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/bard/song-talents/\">Song Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"grant-move-action\">Grant Move Action (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a bard can direct and motivate his allies to act immediately. Once per day, as a move action, he may grant an extra move action to any or all of his allies within 30 feet (but not to himself). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies&rsquo; initiative count; the round continues normally after the bard&rsquo;s turn is over. (This may mean, for example, that an ally whose initiative count immediately follows the bard&rsquo;s may get an extra move action from the bard, followed directly by a full round worth of actions on the ally&rsquo;s turn.) At 6th level and every three bard levels thereafter, a bard gains the ability to grant an extra move action to his allies&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">an additional time</span>&nbsp;per day. A character can take only one extra move action per round. (In other words, two bards can&rsquo;t use this ability on the same ally in the same round.) If an ally chooses not to take the extra move action, it is lost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"major-auras\">Major Aura (Su)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, a bard can project a major aura in addition to his minor aura. A major aura lets allies add +1 morale bonus to certain rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hardy Soldiers:&nbsp;The bard&rsquo;s allies gain damage reduction equal to double the bonus the aura provides.</li>\n<li>Motivate Ardor:&nbsp;Bonus on damage rolls.</li>\n<li>Motivate Attack:&nbsp;Bonus on melee attack rolls.</li>\n<li>Motivate Care:&nbsp;Bonus to Armor Class.</li>\n<li>Motivate Urgency:&nbsp;Allies&rsquo; move speed is increased by 10 feet &times; the amount of bonus the aura provides.</li>\n<li>Resilient Troops:&nbsp;Bonus on all saves.</li>\n<li>Resist the Elements:&nbsp;The bard&rsquo;s allies gain elemental resistance equal to double the bonus the aura provides.</li>\n<li>Steady Hand:&nbsp;Bonus on ranged attack rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dissonance\">Dissonance (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, usable per day equal to half of the bard&rsquo;s level + the bard&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, a bard can perform a mingling set of discordant sounds to cause discord amongst his enemies. Using dissonance requires a Perform check DC 10 + the CR of the creature. The bard&rsquo;s dissonance can affect only a single creature. The target creature must be within 60 feet, and must be able to hear the bard to be affected. Actions vary from the different dissonance abilities as well as duration (if any). The DC of any saving throw called for by a dissonance is equal to 10 + half of the bard&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cackle (Su):&nbsp;As a swift action, the bard emits a disturbing cackle, causing a target creature to become shaken for 1 round. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the target creature becomes shaken for 3 rounds and the DC increases by 1. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the target creature becomes frightened for 1 round instead and the DC increases by 2. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the target creature becomes frightened for 3 rounds and the DC increases by 3. A successful Will save negates the effect. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability.</li>\n<li>Disrupt (Su):&nbsp;As an immediate action, the bard bellows a disconcerting roar, causing a target creature that is attacking to suffer a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty to that specific attack roll. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the penalty increases to &ndash;<wbr />4 and the DC increases by 1. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the penalty increases to &ndash;<wbr />6 and the DC increases by 2. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the penalty increases to &ndash;<wbr />8 and the attacker cannot make multiple attacks and the DC increases by 3. A successful Will save negates the effect. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability.</li>\n<li>Halt (Su):&nbsp;As an immediate action, the bard commands a creature with a loud piercing yell to halt or otherwise stop. The target creature has its movement speed reduced by 5 feet. In addition, the creature cannot run or charge. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the creature&rsquo;s movement speed is reduced by 10 feet instead and the DC increases by 1. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the creature&rsquo;s movement speed is reduced by 15 feet instead and the DC increases by 2. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the creature&rsquo;s movement speed is reduced by 20 feet instead and the DC increases by 3. A successful Will save negates the effect. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#language-dependent\">language-dependent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability.</li>\n<li>Interrupt (Su):&nbsp;As an immediate action, the bard barks a distracting shout, causing a target creature who is casting a spell to need to make a concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell) with a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty or the spell fails. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the penalty increases to &ndash;<wbr />4 and the DC increases by 1. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the penalty increases to &ndash;<wbr />6 and the DC increases by 2. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the penalty increases to &ndash;<wbr />8 and the caster must pay an additional magic point and the DC increases by 3. A successful Will save negates the effect. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability.</li>\n<li>Shatter (Su):&nbsp;As a swift action, the bard emits a piercing cry, causing a target creature or object to take 1d6 + Charisma modifier points of non-<wbr />elemental damage. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the damage increases to 2d6 + Charisma modifier. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the damage increases to 3d6 + Charisma modifier. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the damage increases to 4d6 + Charisma modifier. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half.</li>\n<li>Sickening (Su):&nbsp;As a swift action, the bard creates a sound similar to nails scratching on a chalkboard, causing a target creature to become sickened for 1 round. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the target creature becomes sickened for 3 rounds and the DC increases by 1. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the target creature becomes nauseated for 1 round instead and the DC increases by 2. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the target creature becomes nauseated for 3 rounds and the DC increases by 3. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect.</li>\n<li>Warble (Su):&nbsp;As a swift action, the bard trills a vibrating sound effect, causing a target creature to be staggered for 1 round. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the target creature becomes staggered for 3 rounds and the DC increases by 1. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the target creature becomes dazed for 1 round instead and the DC increases by 2. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the target creature becomes dazed for 3 rounds and the DC increases by 3. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/#mind-affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"additional-song\">Additional Song (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, a bard can perform an additional song, allowing him to perform two songs. At 10th level, the bard can perform three songs and at 20th level, the bard can perform four songs. The Perform check is needed for each song (DC 15 + double the song&rsquo;s level), with a +4 to the perform DC for each song after the first, for a max of +12 for a fourth song. The bard may start these songs in subsequent rounds, but not in the same round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a bard can regain his MP quicker. The bard must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, he could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The bard does not gain this recovery if he is asleep or unconscious. The bard regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five bard levels after 5th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"skilled-performer\">Skilled Performer (Ex)</h3>\n<p>The rattling nerves and jitteriness is long gone, replaced by a calm serenity that allows the bard to play his best music. He gains 5 bonus skill points to any Perform skill at 7th level; this value increases to 10 at 13th level and 15 at 19th level. The bard may distribute the skill points however he wants among his Perform skills.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-song-talents\">Advanced Song Talents (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>At 12th, and every two levels thereafter, a bard learns further talents to assist him in manipulating&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">his songs and class features</span>. He may choose one of the following advanced&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">song</span>&nbsp;talents in place of a&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">song</span>&nbsp;talent. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a bard&rsquo;s s<span lang=\"en-US\">ong-performing</span>&nbsp;ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual s<span lang=\"en-US\">ong</span>&nbsp;and the decision must be made before the s<span lang=\"en-US\">ong</span>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">performed</span>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of advanced song talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/bard/song-talents/\">Advanced Song Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"can't-stop-my-performance\">Can&rsquo;t Stop My Performance (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, a bard becomes immune to all silence and blind spells and effects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstoppable-performance\">Unstoppable Performance (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, a bard can affect deaf and blind creatures with his bardic performances without penalty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-bard\">Master Bard (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, a bard becomes a master of the bardic arts. The DCs of all songs and bardic performances are increased by 2. In addition, once per day, a bard can double the effects of a single minor and major aura for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have bard as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/burmecian/\">Burmecian</a>:&nbsp;Increase the bonus provided by the bard&rsquo;s inspire competence performance by 1/6, and add 1/6 to the number of allies the bard can affect with his inspire greatness performance.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\">Dwarf</a>:&nbsp;Reduce spell failure chance for performing bard songs when wearing medium armor by +1%.
