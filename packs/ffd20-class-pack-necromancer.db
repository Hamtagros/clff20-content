{"name":"Necromancer","permission":{"default":0,"N1fw6b6C7kQcxuhL":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A practitioner of vile and forbidden arts, the necromancer roots about in graveyards, searching out moldering components for her obscene spells. She calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the dead, seeking their arcane secrets. She might be a consummate villain, or perhaps a tortured hero whose obsession with death leads her along questionable moral paths. They often take professions as surgeons, where a few untimely demises are common with the lack of advanced medical techniques and equipment, or undertakers, where fresh bodies aren&rsquo;t hard to find. In either profession, they find acquiring bodies and or organs easy and without drawing too much suspicion. However, a necromancer won&rsquo;t just raise any body. The true pride of a necromancer is constructing her own, choosing the best body parts and lovingly reattaching them to make a monstrosity that would strike the terror into the hearts of the bravest warriors.</p>\n<p>Role:&nbsp;Necromancers often tend to provide support despite their insidious nature, filling roles when needed using their skeletons to protect, to heal, or to attack, while dealing death from afar.</p>\n<p>Alignment:&nbsp;Any non-good alignment</p>\n<p>Hit Die:&nbsp;d6</p>\n<p>Starting Wealth:&nbsp;2d6 &times; 10 gil (average 70 gil.)

Features</h2>\n<p>All of the following are class features of the necromancer.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Necromancers are proficient with the dagger, sling, power rod, power staff, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Heavier armor interferes with a necromancer&rsquo;s movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the necromancer receives the Limit Breaks (Grasp of the Dead and Incorporeal Form).</p>\n<p>Grasp of the Dead (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break causes a swarm of skeletal arms to burst from the ground to rip and tear at the necromancer&rsquo;s foes within 60 feet. The skeletal arms erupt from the ground in a 20-<wbr />foot-<wbr />radius burst. Enemies within the area of effect take 1d6 points of shadow damage per necromancer level. Those caught in the area receive a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the necromancer&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) for half damage. Those who fail the save are unable to move for 1 round. The skeletal arms disappear after 1 round. The arms must burst up from a solid surface.</p>\n<p>Incorporeal Form (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the necromancer to become incorporeal for 1 round + 1 round per four necromancer levels after 1st. While in this form, the necromancer gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#TOC-Incorporeal-Subtype\">incorporeal</a>&nbsp;subtype. He only takes half damage from corporeal sources. Likewise, the necromancer&rsquo;s spells deal only half damage to corporeal creatures. Spells and other effects that do not deal damage function normally. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n<p>A necromancer can cast necromancy spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/necromancer/\">necromancer spell list</a>. A necromancer begins play with 3 1st level necromancy spells of his choice. The necromancer also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his&nbsp;Charisma modifier to add to his list of spells. Each time a character attains a new necromancer level, he gains two spells of his choice to add to his list of spells. The two free spells must be of spell levels he can cast. Like most mages, a necromancer can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to his repertoire.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, the necromancer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-<wbr />level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-<wbr />level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a necromancer&rsquo;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the necromancer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. In addition, a necromancer gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Charisma&mdash;see&nbsp;Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Necromancers are considered to have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a>&nbsp;feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Necromancers learn a number of cantrips, or 0-<wbr />level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Necromancers begin with 4 0-<wbr />level spells and gain an additional 0-<wbr />level spell every three levels after 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bone-commander\">Bone Commander (Su)</h3>\n<p>The necromancer develops a strong connection to the mystic powers of death and learns to walk a path between the living and the dead. He begins play with a bone commander of his choice: Warrior, Rogue, Sniper, or Wizard. This bone commander is a loyal companion that accompanies the necromancer on his adventures and can communicate in common with a raspy voice. It takes a full-<wbr />round action to summon a bone commander. If the necromancer dies, his bone commander is destroyed, and the necromancer must perform a necromantic ritual that requires 8 hours of uninterrupted concentration and costs 100 gil per necromancer level in material components to summon a new bone commander.</p>\n<p>Bone Warrior</p>\n<h5>STARTING STATISTICS</h5>\n<p>Size:&nbsp;Medium;&nbsp;Speed:&nbsp;30 ft.;&nbsp;AC:&nbsp;+1 natural

The necromancer&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to a bone commander for the purpose of determining the bone commander&rsquo;s statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HD:&nbsp;This is the total number of eight-<wbr />sided (d8) Hit Dice the bone commander possesses, but it possesses no Constitution score. Bone commanders use their Charisma score in place of their Constitution score.</p>\n<p>BAB:&nbsp;This is the bone commander&rsquo;s base attack bonus. Bone commanders do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.</p>\n<p>Fort/Ref/Will:&nbsp;These are the bone commander&rsquo;s base saving throw bonuses. A bone commander has good Will saves.</p>\n<p>Skills:&nbsp;This lists the total skill ranks for the bone commander. Bone commanders can assign skill ranks to any skill listed below. A bone commander cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>Bone commanders can have ranks in any of the following skills:</p>\n<p>Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Stealth, and Swim. In addition, at 1st level, the necromancer can choose 4 additional skills to be class skills for his bone commander.</p>\n<p>Feats:&nbsp;This is the total number of feats possessed by a bone commander. Bone commanders can select any feat that they qualify for. Bone commander feats are set once chosen.</p>\n<p>Armor Bonus:&nbsp;The number noted here is an improvement to the bone commander&rsquo;s existing natural armor bonus.</p>\n<p>Primary Ability Bonus:&nbsp;Add this bonus to the bone commander&rsquo;s two primary ability scores. The bone commander&rsquo;s primary ability scores are determined by its base form.</p>\n<p>Secondary Ability Bonus:&nbsp;Add this bonus to the bone commander&rsquo;s secondary ability score. The bone commander&rsquo;s secondary ability score is determined by its base form.</p>\n<p>Ability Score Increase (Ex):&nbsp;The bone commander adds +1 to any one of its ability scores.</p>\n<p>Undead Traits (Ex):&nbsp;The bone commander has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, has immunity to poison, sleep, disable, immobilize and stunning status effects. Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). Not at risk of death from massive damage, but is immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Not affected by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/raise/\">Raise</a>&nbsp;spells or abilities. Absorbs any shadow damage, and takes half again as much from holy damage.</p>\n<p>Armor/Weapon Proficiency (Ex):&nbsp;The bone commander is proficient with weapons and armor according to the class they emulate (as noted above).</p>\n<p>Share Spells (Ex):&nbsp;The necromancer may cast a spell with a target of &ldquo;You&rdquo; on his bone commander (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A necromancer may cast spells on his bone commander even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion&rsquo;s type (undead). This ability does not allow the bone commander to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.</p>\n<p>Link (Ex):&nbsp;A necromancer and his bone commander share a mental link allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the necromancer to give orders to his bone commander at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the necromancer&rsquo;s connection to his bone commander. As a result, the necromancer and his bone commander share magic item slots. For example, if the necromancer is wearing a ring, his bone commander can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the necromancer remain active, and those used by the bone commander become dormant. The bone commander must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.</p>\n<p>Evasion (Ex):&nbsp;If a bone commander is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>\n<p>Improved Evasion (Ex):&nbsp;When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a bone commander takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bolster\">Bolster (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, as a standard action, a necromancer can infuse an undead creature within 30 feet with shadow energy. It gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls and saving throws, as well as 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die and a +2 bonus to its turn resistance. The bonus on attack rolls and saving throws increases by +1 for every five necromancer levels he possesses. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to half his necromancer level (minimum 1 round). He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"undead-body\">Undead Body (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a necromancer begins his journey into undeath. The first symptom is his body&rsquo;s increased resilience to physical harm. He gains DR 1/-<wbr />. As the necromancer increases in level, this DR increases in effectiveness, to DR 2/-<wbr />&nbsp;at 6th level, DR 3/-<wbr />&nbsp;at 10th level, DR 4/-<wbr />&nbsp;at 14th level, and DR 5/-<wbr />&nbsp;at 18th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"undead-body\">Necromancy Talents (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>As a necromancer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that assist him in manipulating undead and empower his necromancy. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, a necromancer gains one necromancy talent. A necromancer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a necromancer&rsquo;s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of necromancy talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/necromancer/necromancy-talents/\">Necromancy Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"harm-touch\">Harm Touch (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a necromancer surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to half his necromancer level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, a necromancer can cause 1d6 points of shadow damage plus an additional 1d6 points of shadow damage for every two necromancer levels he possesses after 3rd. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, a necromancer can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the necromancer possesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lifetap\">Lifetap (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, whenever the necromancer casts single-target spells that deals shadow damage to a living creature, he gains health back equal to spell level of the spell + his Charisma modifier. If this would put him above his normal hit point total, he can transfer the excess to his bone commander. Any excess left over on the bone commander above its normal hit point total dissipates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unholy-fortitude\">Unholy Fortitude (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a necromancer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist sleep, stunning, paralysis, poison, or disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 11th level and then again to +6 at 18th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, a necromancer can regain his MP quicker. The necromancer must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, he could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The necromancer does not gain this recovery if he is asleep or unconscious. The necromancer regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five necromancer levels after 5th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fear-aura\">Fear Aura (Su)</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, a necromancer radiates a 10-<wbr />foot-<wbr />radius fear aura as a free action. Enemies in the area must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + half of his necromancer&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) or become shaken for a number of rounds equal to the necromancer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by that necromancer&rsquo;s fear aura for 24 hours. Starting at 15th level, the fear aura&rsquo;s radius increases to 20 feet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"secrets-of-the-dead\">Secrets of the Dead (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, the number of spirits talking to a necromancer, and the secrets they constantly whisper to him, takes a major upswing. As a result, the necromancer may add his necromancer level to any Knowledge and Diplomacy check regarding a dead or undead person or creature, necromancy, places where people are buried, or ceremonies regarding the dead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cheat-death\">Cheat Death (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, the necromancer&rsquo;s mastery over death and dying has progressed to the point where he can deny a foe the ability to send him into death&rsquo;s embrace in a single, cowardly blow. Whenever anyone attempts a coup de grace on the necromancer, he automatically makes the subsequent Fortitude save. The attacker still deals just as much damage as he normally would, and the necromancer could still die from that damage. Similarly, when he takes massive damage (50 or more points of damage from a single attack), the necromancer automatically succeeds on the Fortitude save to survive the associated trauma, although he can be killed by sheer damage dealt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"life-sight\">Life Sight (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, the necromancer gains a form of blindsight that can detect living and undead creatures. The necromancer can only distinguish if the target is living or undead; constructs, oozes and equipment carried by the targets cannot be seen. The targets appear as semi-<wbr />colorful silhouettes, and can be seen up to a range of 60 feet. Activating or deactivating this ability is a swift action, and turns the necromancer&rsquo;s eyes black or dull grey. Spells that blind the necromancer have a 50% chance of negating this form of blindsight; blindfolds and shades have do not block life sight, but do block normal vision as usual.</p>\n<p>At 13th level the range increases from 60 feet to 120 feet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unlife-healer\">Unlife Healer (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 8th level, the necromancer&rsquo;s spells, spell-<wbr />like abilities, and supernatural abilities used to heal undead gain the benefit of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/metamagic-feats/empower-spell/\">Empower Spell</a>&nbsp;feat. At 16th level, these effects also gain the benefit of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/metamagic-feats/maximize-spell/\">Maximize Spell</a>&nbsp;feat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"miasma\">Miasma (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, if a creature is within the necromancer&rsquo;s fear aura at the beginning of its turn, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC 10 + half of the necromancer&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier or become sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours, as are creatures immune to disease.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fortification\">Unholy Protection (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, a necromancer&rsquo;s skin hardens, gaining light fortification (25% immunity to critical hits). At 17th level, the necromancer gains moderate fortification (50% immunity to critical hits).</p>\n<h3 id=\"undead-mastery\">Undead Mastery (Su)</h3>\n<p>All undead creatures created by a necromancer who has reached 11th level or higher gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 2 additional hit points per Hit Die.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-of-death\">Master of Undeath (Su)</h3>\n<p>As the necromancer comes closer and closer to his ultimate ascension into undeath, he also becomes more aware of how weak he used to be. At 12th level, when activating this ability as a standard action, he may choose between body and mind. Master of undeath lasts for a number of rounds equal to the necromancer&rsquo;s caster level. He may use this ability one time per day per four necromancer levels he possesses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Body:&nbsp;The necromancer sheds his life&rsquo;s shell and temporarily gains the undead subtype. While under this effect the necromancer loses his constitution score and gain the traits of an undead creature. This effect renders the necromancer medically dead for its duration.</li>\n<li>Mind:&nbsp;The necromancer gains spell resistance equal to 10 + necromancer level. Furthermore, any time the necromancer is forced to make a Will save, he may roll twice and take the best of both rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"undead-body\">Advanced Necromancy Talents (Ex or Su)</h3>\n<p>At 12th, and every two levels thereafter, a necromancer learns further talents to assist him in manipulating undead and mastering necromancy. He may choose one of the following advanced necromancy talents in place of a necromancy talent. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a necromancer&rsquo;s spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of advanced necromancy talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/necromancer/necromancy-talents/\">Advanced Necromancy Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"deaths-kiss\">Death&rsquo;s Kiss (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, when the necromancer casts a necroman<span lang=\"en-US\">cy</span>&nbsp;spell that conjures or creates undead, those created gain bonus hit points equal to half&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">his necromancer</span>&nbsp;level and gain a bonus to any saving throws versus effects that would damage, turn, or destroy them equal to&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">his</span>&nbsp;Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destruction-retribution\">Destruction Retribution (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 16th level, when any undead the necromancer summoned is destroyed, it releases a burst of dark energy upon its destruction, dealing 1d6 points of shadow damage plus an additional 1d6 points per 2 Hit Dice to every creature within a 10-<wbr />foot burst, a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the undead&rsquo;s Hit Dice + necromancer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) for half damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deathly-abeyance\">Deathly Abeyance (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, the necromancer can hold the spirits of death at bay, preventing an ally from dying. A number of times per day equal to the necromancer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, as an immediate reaction, he can grant a creature within 30 feet that would die a second chance at life. If the target would die from an attack that deals damage, the necromancer can take the damage onto himself, preventing the ally from dying.</p>\n<p>If the target would die as a result of a failed saving throw, the necromancer grants the target an immediate second saving throw. If the die roll of the second saving throw is a 1-<wbr />10, the target adds +10 to the die roll (resulting in a die roll that must fall between 11-<wbr />20). If the second save succeeds, the target does not die, though it suffers any other consequence of the effect. If the second save fails, the target still dies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-guide\">Final Guide (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, a necromancer can actually guide the spirit of a slain creature back to its body a number of times per day equal to the necromancer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, restoring the creature to life. This is only possible if the spirit is nearby, and thus this power must be used within 10 minutes since the creature&rsquo;s death. This functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/a/arise/\">Arise</a>&nbsp;spell except the casting time is 1 full round. Once a creature has been restored to life by a necromancer&rsquo;s final guide ability, that creature cannot benefit from that ability again (from any necromancer) until 24 hours has passed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lich-transformation\">Lich Transformation (Su)</h3>\n<p>When a necromancer attains 20th level, he undergoes a hideous transformation and becomes a lich. The necromancer gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/lich/\">lich template</a>&nbsp;(alignment reminds unchanged), forming a phylactery to house his soul in, as if he crafted it on his own.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have necromancer as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\">Dwarf</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/6 bonus of DR 1/-<wbr />&nbsp;to the necromancer&rsquo;s damage reduction.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/elvaan/\">Elvaan</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 hit point or +1 skill rank to the necromancer&rsquo;s bone commander.
