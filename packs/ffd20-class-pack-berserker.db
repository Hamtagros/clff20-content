In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors&mdash;they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as berserkers, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within berserkers storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>\n<p>Role: Berserkers excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, berserkers charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>\n<p>Alignment: Any non-lawful</p>\n<p>Hit Die: d12</p>\n<p>Starting Wealth:&nbsp;3d6 &times; 10 gil (average 105 gil.)

following are class features of the berserker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>A berserker is proficient with all simple weapons and all the weapons from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/equipment/weapons/\">axes and hammers weapon group</a>. A berserker is also proficient with light and medium armor but is prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, he may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor and not with any shields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the berserker receives the Limit Breaks (The Unmovable Force and The Unstoppable Force).</p>\n<p>The Unmovable Force (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the berserker to go on the defensive. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four berserker levels after 1st, the berserker gains a damage reduction of 2/- and an elemental resistance to all elements of 2. This bonus increases by 2 per four berserker levels after 1st. In addition, while under this limit break, the berserker gains a +2 morale bonus to his CMD versus trip, bull rush, and reposition combat maneuvers, with an additional +2 morale bonus per four berserker levels after 1st. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p>The Unstoppable Force (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break imbues the berserker with phenomenal strength and destructive power. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four berserker levels after 1st, all bonuses from rage and from any rage abilities are doubled. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fast-movement\">Fast Movement (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A berserker&rsquo;s land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the berserker&rsquo;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the berserker&rsquo;s land speed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rage\">Rage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A berserker can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting him additional combat prowess. At 1st level, a berserker can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. For each level after 1st he possesses, the berserker can rage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as that gained from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dwarfs-endurance/\">dwarf&rsquo;s endurance</a>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a berserker can rage per day. A berserker can enter a rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>While in a rage, a berserker gains the benefits of his rage form, gains a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws but takes a &ndash;2 penalty to her Armor Class. He also gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. At 11th level this increases to 3 temporary hit points per level, and at 20th level this increases to 4 temporary hit points per level. These temporary hit points are lost first when a character takes damage, disappear when the rage ends, and are not replenished if the berserker enters a rage again within 1 minute of his previous rage. While in a rage, a berserker cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). A berserker can end his rage as a free action and is fatigued for 1 minute after a rage ends. This fatigue cannot be reduced or mitigated in any way and applies even to normally fatigue-immune characters, but can be cured as normal. A berserker can&rsquo;t enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a rage multiple times per day. If a berserker falls unconscious, his rage immediately ends. Rage does not stack with defensive stance.</p>\n<p>A berserker who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to rage while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rage-forms\">Rage Forms (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, a berserker selects one of the following rage forms. He selects an additional rage form at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels. Whenever he rages, he enters into one of his selected rage forms. A berserker cannot change rage forms while in a rage.</p>\n<p>Animal Rage (Ex):&nbsp;While raging, the berserker gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at the berserker&rsquo;s full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if Small) plus the berserker&rsquo;s Strength modifier. The bite deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if Small) plus the berserker&rsquo;s Strength modifier. If he already has claw and bite attacks, he deals damage as if the berserker were one size larger (this does not stack with other effects which increase the effective size of natural attacks).</p>\n<p>Greater Animal Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, while raging, the berserker also gains a gore attack. This attack is considered a primary attack and is made at the berserker&rsquo;s full base attack bonus. The gore attack deal 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if Small) plus the berserker&rsquo;s Strength modifier. If he already a gore attack, he deals damage as if the berserker were one size larger (this does not stack with other effects which increase the effective size of natural attacks).</p>\n<p>Mighty Animal Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, while raging, the berserker increases by one size larger, gaining all the benefits and penalties of being a larger size. In addition, all natural attacks deal damage as if they were one size larger (larger than the current size when raging).</p>\n<p>Battle Meditation (Ex):&nbsp;While in a rage, a berserker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC. This AC bonus does not negate the AC penalty from raging.</p>\n<p>Greater Battle Meditation (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on attack rolls and AC while raging increases to +3.</p>\n<p>Mighty Battle Meditation (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on attack rolls and AC while raging increases to +4.</p>\n<p>Close Quarters Rage (Ex):&nbsp;While in a rage, a berserker gains a +2 bonus on ranged attack and damage rolls, but only against targets within the first range increment of his attack. Against a target within 10 feet, the berserker&rsquo;s critical multiplier for damage increases by 1 (a &times;2 multiplier becomes &times;3, a &times;3 multiplier becomes &times;4, and a &times;4 multiplier becomes &times;5). This critical multiplier increase does not stack with other effects which increase critical multipliers. While raging, the berserker doubles his attack penalty due to range increments.</p>\n<p>Greater Close Quarters Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on ranged attack and damage rolls while raging increases to +3.</p>\n<p>Mighty Close Quarters Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on ranged attack and damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4.</p>\n<p>Closing Wounds Rage (Su):&nbsp;While in a rage, a berserker gains fast healing 5. When he scores a critical hit, he gains 10 temporary hit points that lasts until the end of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Greater Closing Wounds Rage (Su):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker gains fast healing 10. When he scores a critical hit, he gains 20 temporary hit points that lasts until the end of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Mighty Closing Wounds Rage (Su):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker gains fast healing 15. When he scores a critical hit, he gains 40 temporary hit points that lasts until the end of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Destructive Rage (Ex):&nbsp;While in a rage, a berserker gains a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and sunder combat maneuvers. He ignores 5 points of a target&rsquo;s damage resistance and object hardness.</p>\n<p>Greater Destructive Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and sunder combat maneuvers while raging increases to +3. He ignores 10 points of a target&rsquo;s damage resistance and object hardness.</p>\n<p>Mighty Destructive Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and sunder combat maneuvers while raging increases to +4. He ignores 20 points of a target&rsquo;s damage resistance and object hardness.</p>\n<p>Dueling Rage (Ex):&nbsp;When a berserker enters a rage, he chooses one target within sight to challenge. While in a rage, he gains a +3 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against the target of his challenge. The berserker does not take the &ndash;2 penalty to his Armor Class for being in rage against attacks made by the target of his challenge. If the target of the challenge is killed, the berserker exits his rage. The challenge ends when the berserker exits the rage.</p>\n<p>Greater Dueling Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against the target of his challenge increases to +4.</p>\n<p>Mighty Dueling Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against the target of his challenge increases to +5.</p>\n<p>Elemental Rage (Su):&nbsp;When a berserker enters a rage, he chooses an element type (earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind). While in a rage, he gains an elemental aura of the chosen element type. Creatures within five feet of the berserker at start of his turn take 1d6 points of element damage of the selected type. The berserker&rsquo;s attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of element damage of the selected type.</p>\n<p>Greater Elemental Rage (Su):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker&rsquo;s elemental aura deals 2d6 points of element damage.</p>\n<p>Mighty Elemental Rage (Su):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker&rsquo;s elemental aura deals 4d6 points of element damage.</p>\n<p>Invincible Rage (Ex):&nbsp;While in a rage, a berserker gains damage reduction (2/-) and resistance against all elemental attacks equal to 2. This damage reduction and elemental resistance stack with other damage reduction or elemental resistance gained from class abilities or rage powers. He also gains a +2 bonus on all Fortitude and Reflex Saves.</p>\n<p>Greater Invincible Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker&rsquo;s damage reduction and elemental resistance increases to 5 and his bonus to Fortitude and Reflex Saves increases to +3.</p>\n<p>Mighty Invincible Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker&rsquo;s damage reduction and elemental resistance increases to 10 and his bonus to Fortitude and Reflex Saves increases to +4.</p>\n<p>Terrifying Rage (Ex):&nbsp;While in a rage, a berserker gains a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls. He also gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to his berserker level.</p>\n<p>Greater Terrifying Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 11th level, a berserker gains a +3 bonus on melee damage rolls. He also gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to his berserker level. In addition, he can use the Intimidate skill as a move action.</p>\n<p>Mighty Terrifying Rage (Ex):&nbsp;At 20th level, a berserker gains a +4 bonus on melee damage rolls. He also gains a +20 bonus on Intimidate checks. In addition, he can use the Intimidate skill as a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rage-powers\">Rage Powers (Ex)</h3>\n<p>As a berserker gains levels, he learns to use his rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a berserker gains a rage power. He gains another rage power for every two levels of berserker attained after 2nd level. A berserker gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the berserker to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a berserker cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>\n<p>Some of the following rage powers are stances. Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A berserker can&rsquo;t have more than one stance rage power active at a time. If he activates a stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning of the berserker&rsquo;s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the rage ends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of rage powers can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/berserker/rage-powers/\">Rage Powers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"uncanny-dodge\">Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, a berserker gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to armor class if immobilized. A berserker with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to armor class if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>\n<p>If a berserker already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"danger-sense\">Danger Sense (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a berserker gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every three berserker levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from other danger senses (if the berserker has danger sense from another class).</p>\n<h3 id=\"confuse\">Confuse Immunity (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, a berserker is immune to the Confuse status effect while in a rage. While not in a rage, he gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that inflict the Confuse status. This bonus improves by 2 per four berserker levels after 3rd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destructive\">Destructive (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, whenever the berserker makes a melee attack that targets an unattended object or makes a sunder combat maneuver, he adds half his berserker level on the damage roll.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-uncanny-dodge\">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level and higher, a berserker can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a thief the ability to sneak attack the berserker by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more thief levels than the target has berserker levels.</p>\n<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum thief level required to flank the character.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blood-rush\">Blood Rush (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Also at 5th level, the thrill of felling an enemy in the heat of battle further emboldens the berserker&rsquo;s resolve. For each enemy creature the berserker incapacitates or kills while raging, he gains a stacking +1 bonus to all damage rolls, up to the berserker&rsquo;s level. This bonus lasts until the rage ends, increasing by 1 for every five berserker levels thereafter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"damage-reduction\">Damage Reduction (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 7th level, a berserker gains damage reduction 1/-. At 10th level and every three berserker levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1. This damage reduction is doubled against nonlethal damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bloodlust\">Bloodlust (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 8th level, a berserker&rsquo;s eagerness for bloodshed makes him quicker to act in a fight. He adds his Charisma modifier to initiative checks and always acts during the surprise round. If the berserker is surprised during the surprise round, he acts last in that round and then determines initiative order normally for the remainder of combat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"silent-threat\">Silent Threat (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, a berserker exudes hostility, creating a threatening atmosphere in his presence. The berserker gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks, and the DCs of Intimidate checks to demoralize or antagonize his enemies within 30 feet increase by 1. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 1 at 12th level and every three berserker levels thereafter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"greater-rage\">Greater Rage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, a berserker in a rage gains the benefit of his greater rage form. While raging, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +3. While raging, he is immune to fear effects. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 3 per Hit Die.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fearless-killer\">Fearless Killer (Su)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, a berserker becomes implacable in his pursuit of slaughter. While in rage, he is immune to mind-affecting spells and effects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"indomitable-will\">Indomitable Will (Ex)</h3>\n<p>While in rage, a berserker of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enfeebling spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rage-strike\">Rage Strike (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 15th level, whenever the berserker scores a natural 20 critical hit on a target, the berserker may spend 1 round of rage to rend his target&rsquo;s flesh apart in a rage strike. The target must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the berserker&rsquo;s level + the berserker&rsquo;s Strength modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tireless-rage\">Tireless Rage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level and higher, a berserker no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage. If he enters a rage again within 1 minute of ending a rage, he doesn&rsquo;t gain any temporary hit points from his rage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-escape\">No Escape (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 17th level, moving out of the area of the berserker with a withdraw action provokes an attack of opportunity from the berserker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unstoppable\">Unstoppable (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, nothing can kill the berserker, though not for lack of trying. The berserker gains DR 3/&mdash; or increases the value of any existing damage reduction by 3. In addition, he gains elemental resistance to earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, and wind equal to his DR/&mdash; value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mighty-rage\">Mighty Rage (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, a berserker in a rage gains the benefit of his mighty rage form. While raging, a berserker&rsquo;s bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 4 per Hit Die.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.
