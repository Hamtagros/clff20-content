following are class features of the astrologian.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Astrologians are proficient with the club, sling, power rod, power staff, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Heavier armor interferes with an astrologian&rsquo;s movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the astrologian receives the Limit Breaks (Celestial Opposition and Kinetic Card).</p>\n<p>Celestial Opposition (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break causes the universe to move in a way beyond fate&rsquo;s predestined plans. All enemies within a 30-<wbr />ft.-<wbr />radius of the astrologian are stunned for 1 round + 1 round per four astrologian levels after 1st. A successful Will save (DC 10 + half of the astrologian&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier) negates this effect. Additionally, it either removes one negative status effect from an ally or one positive status effect from an enemy, plus an additional removal per four astrologian levels after 1st.</p>\n<p>Kinetic Card (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break allows the astrologian to fire a barrage of tarot cards in a 30-<wbr />ft.-<wbr />cone. Enemies within the area of effect take 2d6 points of non-<wbr />elemental damage plus an additional 2d6 per four astrologian levels after 1st. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the astrologian&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier) halves the damage. In addition, if enemies fail the saving throw, the tarot card explodes (no save), dealing 1d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 per four astrologian levels after 1st.</p>\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n<p>An astrologian casts astromancy spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells-by-class/astrologian/\">astrologian spell list</a>. An astrologian begins play with 3 1st level astromancy spells of her choice. The astrologian also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Wisdom modifier to add to her list of spells. Each time a character attains a new astrologian level, she gains two spells of her choice to add to her list of spells. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. Like most mages, an astrologian can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, the astrologian must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-<wbr />level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-<wbr />level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a astrologian&rsquo;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the astrologian&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. In addition, an astrologian gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom&mdash;see&nbsp;Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level)&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/system-rules/mp-system/\">MP System page</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"globe\">Star Globe&nbsp; (Su)</h3>\n<p>Beginning of 1st level, as a free action, the astrologian is able to summon a star globe. A star globe is a glowing orb in which a deck of tarot cards flows around it. It is the central foci for the astrologian&rsquo;s Draw abilities. Functioning only in the hands of an astrologian, the star globe deals 1d4 + Wisdom modifier points of damage. The astrologian must make a ranged touch attack that has a range of 25 feet + 5 feet per two astrologian levels after 1st. The star globe disappears if the astrologian is unconscious, dead, or if it leaves the astrologian&rsquo;s hands for any length of time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spell-proficiency\">Spell Proficiency (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Astrologians are considered to have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat/\">Precise Shot</a>&nbsp;feat while casting spells, using class features that require ranged touch or using any magical items that require ranged touch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Astrologians learn a number of cantrips, or 0-<wbr />level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Astrologians begin with 4 0-<wbr />level spells and gain an additional 0-<wbr />level spell every three levels after 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prescience\">Prescience (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, at the beginning of the astrologian&rsquo;s turn, as a free action, she may roll a single d20. At any point before her next turn, she may use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll she is required to make. If she does not use the d20 result before her next turn, it is lost. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"draw\">Draw (Su)</h3>\n<p>Also at 1st level, an astrologian utilizes a special deck of tarot cards that float around her star globe. As a swift action, she may draw a card at random, rolling a 1d6 (see below). Once drawn, an astrologian may imbue the effects of the card on a single target within 30 feet. At 5th level and every four levels thereafter, the effects of the card increases by 1. The duration of the card&rsquo;s effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the astrologian&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier.The astrologian may use this ability a number of times per day equal to her astrologian level + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Astrologian: Draw</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-14\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Tarot Card</th>\n<th>Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The Arrow (Su)</td>\n<td>This card grants the target a +1 luck bonus to attack rolls.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>The Balance (Su)</td>\n<td>This card grants the target a +1 luck bonus to damage rolls.

In addition, she receives a bonus on initiative checks equal to her Wisdom modifier. At 20th level, anytime she rolls initiative, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anticipate-danger\">Anticipate Danger (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, t<span lang=\"en-US\">he astrologian&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;knowledge of the future allows&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">her</span>&nbsp;to anticipate danger.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;gains a +1 bonus to Perception checks and a +1 dodge bonus to AC. Theses bonuses increase by +2 at 6th level and every four astrologian levels thereafter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fateful-touch\">Fateful Touch (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">the astrologian</span>&nbsp;can touch a creature as a standard action, granting them the ability to automatically roll a Natural 20 on one saving throw, skill check, or ability check. The automatic success must be used within one minute of being touched. The astrologian may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightspeed\">Lightspeed (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, the astrologian may cast any healing or damage spell as a swift action, but it deals half as it normally would. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"astrology-secret\">Astrology Secret (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an astrologian uncovers a new secret about the celestial bodies that grants her powers and abilities. The astrologian must select a secret from the list of secrets below. If a secret is chosen at a later level, the astrologian gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that secret based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a secret is a standard action. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these secrets is equal to 10 + half of the astrologian&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of astrology secrets can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/astrologian/astrology-secrets/\">Astrology Secrets</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"royal-road\">Royal Road (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, the astrologian&rsquo;s understanding of fortunetelling has grown considerably, allowing her to augment her tarot cards further. After she uses the Draw ability, she may use a free action to convert that card into an empowerment for a future reading. This empowerment affects the next card that the astrologian uses to empower an ally, from either the Draw ability or Spread ability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the Balance or the Bole card is drawn, the effects are doubled.</li>\n<li>If the Arrow or the Shield card is drawn, the duration is doubled.</li>\n<li>If the Ewer or the Spire card is drawn, all allies within a 20-<wbr />ft.-<wbr />radius of the astrologian receive the effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insight\">Insight (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 4th level, as an immediate action, the astrologian can immediately gain a bonus to her Reflex saving throws equal to her astrologian level. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"minor-arcana\">Minor Arcana (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, as a free action, the astrologian converts the currently drawn card into the Lord of Crowns when Balance, Arrow, or Shield, or the Lady of Crowns when Bole, Ewer, or Spire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lord of Crowns (Su):&nbsp;This card grants the bonuses of all three cards of Balance, Arrow, and Shield.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lady of Crowns (Su):&nbsp;This card grants the bonuses of all three cards of Bole, Ewer, and Spire.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The astrologian can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-mind\">Clear Mind (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, an astrologian can regain her MP quicker. The astrologian must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. For example, she could be riding in the back of a carriage and benefit from this ability. The astrologian does not gain this recovery if she is asleep or unconscious. The astrologian regains 1 MP per hour. This increases by 1 for every five astrologian levels after 5th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-heavenly-paths\">The Heavenly Paths (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, early on in astrologian&rsquo;s studies, she learns about two different sects that map the stars using the positions of the sun and the moon and these two sects are reflective of their reference points. The Diurnal Sect uses the sun as their reference point, creating star maps with the sun being the key to navigation, while the Nocturnal Sect uses the moon as the reference point. The astrologian imbues herself with a specific sect and draws the powers from them. The astrologian may switch between sects as a swift action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diurnal Sect (Su):&nbsp;The astrologian is able to empower her healing spells with the power of the sun. When she casts a spell that restores the hit points of an ally, she may leave a regenerative effect. After the spell is cast, allies affected gain Fast Healing equal to the spell&rsquo;s level for a number of rounds equal to the astrologian&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. Multiple healing spells do not stack, but refreshes the duration.</li>\n<li>Nocturnal Sect (Su):&nbsp;The astrologian is able to empower her healing spells with the power of the moon. When she casts a spell that restores the hit points of an ally, she may leave a shielding effect. After the spell is cast, allies affected gain Damage Reduction/- equal to the spell&rsquo;s level for a number of rounds equal to the astrologian&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. Multiple healing spells do not stack, but refreshes the duration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"essential-dignity\">Essential Dignity (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, the astrologian&rsquo;s healing spells become empowered as if using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/metamagic-feats/empower-spell/\">Empower Spell</a>&nbsp;metamagic feat when healing any ally that is below 50% health, including area of effect healing spells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"knowledge\">Knowledge of the Ages (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">the astrologian</span>&nbsp;can search through time to recall some bit of forgotten lore or information.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;can retry any Knowledge skill check&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;has made within the past minute, gaining an insight bonus on the check equal to&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">he</span>r&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Wisdom</span>&nbsp;modifier.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;can use this ability a number times per day equal to&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">her Wisdom</span>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-over\">Do-Over (Su)</h3>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">At&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"en-US\">7</span><span lang=\"en-US\">th level, the astrologian</span>&nbsp;may immediately reroll a failed skill check, saving throw or attack roll.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;must accept the second roll regardless of its value.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">he</span>r Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spread\">Spread (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 8th level, the astrologian&rsquo;s studies into astromancy has led her to a better understanding of reading fortunes. As a free action after using the Draw ability, the astrologian may set a drawn card aside for later use. This card is added to her spread and can be activated as a free action during her turn. The card sits in her spread until used and may only have 1 card at a time in her spread. The card in the spread expires anytime the astrologian is unconscious.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sect-power\">Sect Powers (Su)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, the astrologian receives powers from her sect. She receives a power at 8th level and after 3 levels thereafter. She must be in a sect required by the power.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of sect powers can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/astrologian/sect-powers/\">Sect Powers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"synastry\">Synastry (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, the astrologian can create an aetheric bond with an ally. As a move action, the astrologian can choose an ally within 30 feet to bond with and any healing spells the astrologian casts that heals a creature not affected by the bond heals the bonded ally for half of the amount the spell healed for. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to the astrologian&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier and is usable a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-sight\">Future Sight (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 9th level, once each day, the astrologian may declare that an action&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;has just taken did not happen.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;may then take a different action.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;can do this after the results of&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">he</span>r action are known. The mixing of future and present is disorienting.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;is shaken for 1d4 rounds after&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;uses this ability. This does not stack with other fear effects, but nothing can remove this condition. At 12th level, and every&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">three astrologian</span>&nbsp;levels thereafter,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;can use this ability an additional time per day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"divination\">Divination (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, the astrologian can bestow a powerful effect on herself and her nearby allies. The astrologian and any allies within 30 feet are granted a +2 bonus on damage rolls for each drawn card in effect for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier. At 15th and 20th level, this bonus increases by 1 for each drawn card in effect. The astrologian can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sleeve-draw\">Sleeve Draw (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 11th level, the astrologian can draw multiple of cards.

The result of the reroll must be taken, even if it is worse than the original roll.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;can use this ability once per day at 12th level, and one additional time per day for every four astrologian levels beyond 12th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shuffle\">Shuffle (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 12th level, the astrologian has mastered basic fortunetelling, allowing her to manipulate fate in her readings to a certain extent. After using the Draw ability, she may use a free action to redraw from the deck, effectively rerolling. The drawn card is returned to the deck to be read another day, and she may use the Draw ability again. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"foretell\">Foretell (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, the astrologian can utter a prediction of the immediate future. While her foretelling is in effect, she emits a 30-<wbr />foot aura of fortune that aids her allies or hinders her enemies, as chosen by the astrologian at the time of prediction. If she chooses to aid, she and her allies gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If she chooses to hinder, her enemies take a &ndash;2 penalty on those rolls instead. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her Wisdom modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"far-seer\">Far Seer (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 13th level, a<span lang=\"en-US\">n astrologian</span>&nbsp;learns a method of&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">divination</span>&nbsp;that is especially suited for divining and understanding the future, but not for directly harming opponents. For the purpose of determining what level spell she expends when&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">spending MP</span>, the as<span lang=\"en-US\">trologian</span>&nbsp;treats the spell level of spells that predict the future (such as augury and divination) as one spell level lower (minimum spell level 1st).</p>\n<h3 id=\"defy-death\">Defy Death (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, once per day, when an attack or spell that causes damage would result in&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">the astrologian&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;death,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;may attempt a DC 20 Will save.

For a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier, the astrologian gains the effects of both of her Heavenly Paths. The astrologian can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-dilation\">Time Dilation (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 16th level, the astrologian pulses out a time dilation, enabling her to rewrite time a little bit. The astrologian and her allies within a 30-<wbr />ft.-<wbr />radius that have any daily abilities regains one use. This ability may be only used once a day and is not affected by itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chosen-destiny\">Chosen Destiny (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 16th level, the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">astrologian</span>&nbsp;is the master of her own destiny. Whenever the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">astrologian</span>&nbsp;makes a saving throw against a<span lang=\"en-US\">n enfeebling spell or</span>&nbsp;effect, she may roll twice and take the better result. In addition, once per day, the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">astrologian</span>&nbsp;can treat any one d20 roll as if the result were a natural 20. She must declare the use of this ability before the roll is made.</p>\n<h3 id=\"read-the-stars\">Read the Stars (Su)</h3>\n<p>Many charlatans claim to read the stars and portend weal or woe, but an astrologian truly has this ability. At 17th level, when the astro<span lang=\"en-US\">logian</span>&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">casts augury</span>&nbsp;and the die roll succeeds, she and up to 10 allies gain a +1 insight bonus to ability checks, skill checks, saving throws, and attack rolls for 24 hrs. If the divination roll fails, she and her allies instead incur a &ndash;2 penalty on those rolls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collective-unconscious\">Collective Unconscious (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 18th level, the astrologian creates a 20-<wbr />ft.-<wbr />radius dome over herself, centered on her. It lasts a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier, and while inside the dome, the astrologian and her allies gain Fast Healing equal to half of her astrologian levels and damage is reduced by 50%. The astrologian must concentrate on this ability as a full-<wbr />round action each round otherwise the ability stops. This ability is usable only once per day, even if it ended prematurely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heavens\">The Heavens to Us (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 18th level, the astro<span lang=\"en-US\">logian</span>&nbsp;has honed her ability to call material from the stars.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Sh</span>e can fill an area equal to a 60-ft.-diameter sphere with the void of space, which deals 10d6 points of&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">ice</span>&nbsp;damage and immediately suffocates all creatures within the sphere, a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the astrologian&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier) for half damage and staggered for 1 round rather than suffocated. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destiny-realized\">Destiny Realized (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">the astrologian&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;moment of destiny is at hand. Any critical threats made against her only confirm if the second roll results in a natural 20 on the die. Any critical threats&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;scores with a spell are automatically confirmed. Once per day,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">she</span>&nbsp;can automatically succeed at one caster level check made to overcome spell resistance.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">She</span>&nbsp;must use this ability before making the roll.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-astrologian\">Master Astrologian (Su)</h3>\n<p>Upon achieving 20th level, the astrologian&rsquo;s rapport with the heavens grants her perfect harmony with the universe. She receives an insight bonus on all saving throws equal to her Wisdom modifier. She automatically stabilizes if she is below 0 hit points, is immune to fear effects and to critical hits. Should the astrologian die, she is reborn 3 days later in the form of a star child, who matures over the course of 7 days (treat as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/r/raise/\">raise</a>&nbsp;spell).</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes.
