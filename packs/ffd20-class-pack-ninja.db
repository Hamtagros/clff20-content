class features of the ninja.</p>\n<h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Ninjas are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the bolas, chakram, fuma shuriken, kama, katana, kunai, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, starknife, wakizashi, and wushu dart. They are proficient with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor#light-armors\">light armor</a>&nbsp;but not with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor#shields\">shields</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-breaks\">Limit Breaks (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, the ninja receives the Limit Breaks (Missile Barrage and Shroud in Darkness).</p>\n<p>Missile Barrage (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break creates hundreds of thrown weapons that the ninja throws a barrage of them in a 30-ft.-cone. Enemies within the area of effect take 1d6 points of shadow damage per ninja level, a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of the ninja&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier) for half damage.</p>\n<p>Shroud in Darkness (Su):&nbsp;This Limit Break makes the ninja invisible for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four ninja levels after 1st. While invisible, the ninja can make attacks as normal and remain invisible. The ninja also receives a +1d6 sneak attack bonus + an additional 1d6 per four ninja levels after 1st while under this Limit Break. This limit break requires only a swift action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sneak-attack\">Sneak Attack (Ex)</h3>\n<p>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The ninja&rsquo;s attack deals extra damage (called &ldquo;precision damage&rdquo;) anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &ndash;4 penalty. The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ac-bonus\">AC Bonus (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A ninja is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, a ninja adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and her CMD. In addition, a ninja gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 1st level. This ability does not stack with the monk&rsquo;s AC bonus ability (a ninja with levels of monk does not add the bonus twice). This bonus increases by 1 for every four levels thereafter (+2 at 5th, +3 at 9th, +4 at 13th, and +5 at 17th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the ninja is flat-<wbr />footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p>\n<h3 id=\"throw-anything\">Throw Anything (Ex)</h3>\n<p>All ninjas gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/throw-anything-combat-final/\">Throw Anything</a>&nbsp;feat as a bonus feat at 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evasion\">Evasion (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, a ninja can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ninja is wearing light armor, or no armor. A helpless ninja (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ninja-tricks\">Ninja Tricks (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a ninja&rsquo;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of ninja tricks can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/ninja/ninja-tricks/\">Ninja Tricks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"ki-pool\">Ki Pool (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja&rsquo;s ki pool is equal to half her ninja level + her Wisdom modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by half (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>\n<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting ninjutsus.</p>\n<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-trace\">No Trace (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ninjutsu\">Ninjutsu (Su)</h3>\n<p>As a ninja continues her training, she learns ninjutsu that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 3rd level and every other level thereafter, a ninja learns a new ninjutsu from the list below. Some ninjutsu have prerequisites. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninjutsu more than once.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of ninjutsu can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/ninja/ninjutsu/\">Ninjutsu</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"uncanny-dodge\">Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a ninja can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-<wbr />footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A ninja with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her. If a ninja already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"light-steps\">Light Steps (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-uncanny-dodge\">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h3>\n<p>A ninja of 8th level can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies creatures the flanking bonus by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more ninja levels than the target does.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloaked-in-shadows\">Cloaked in Shadows (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, a ninja&rsquo;s ability to be stealthy becomes second-nature. A ninja with this ability is always considered to be taking 10 on Stealth skill checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-tricks\">Master Tricks</h3>\n<p>At 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of master tricks can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/ninja/ninja-tricks/#master-tricks\">Master Tricks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"hide-in-plain-sight\">Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, the ninja can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shadow-step\">Shadow Step (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 19th level, as a move action, the ninja can step into the shadows and appear out of a shadow within 30 feet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hidden-master\">Hidden Master (Su)</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/v/vanish-superior/\">superior vanish</a>&nbsp;on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>\n<h2>Favored Class Bonuses</h2>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have ninja as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/al-bhed/\">Al Bhed</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/3 on critical hit confirmation rolls made while using sneak attack (maximum bonus of +5).

In combat, this option has no effect unless the ninja has selected it five times (or another increment of five).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/core-races/dwarf/\">Dwarf</a>:&nbsp;Gain a +1/3 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and on Survival checks when underground.
